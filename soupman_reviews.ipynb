There's a kind of restaurant that basically only does a single thing. They do it really well, focus on absolutely nothing else, and it's great. That's the Soupman.They don't have anywhere to sit and barely even have enough space for a line to form. They sell practically nothing other than 8-10 daily soup varieties (there is a single sandwich I haven't tried yet). They don't really care about presentation or customer service. But damn do they make good soup.The soups are rich, thick with quality chunks of ingredients, and deeply flavorful. This has been true for the potato bacon, the jambalaya, the lobster bisque, and the tomato bisque. They're just very strong. Every soup also comes with a piece of bread, a fruit (I've usually gotten a banana) and an Andes mint. It's a good value for the money. I plan to come back here many times.\n",

As long as you place your order and move to the left. On any given day, they have many different types of soup. The soup is usually served with a piece of fruit and bread or crackers. I highly recommend this carry out spot. Lastly, if you are a Seinfeld fan, you'll definitely love the spot, it's  very nostalgic. The Soup Nazi\n",

      "This is a strong 4-star review, I definitely recommend the Original Soup Kitchen.One of my favorite kinds of places to get food is the single-item specialty store. There's a kind of restaurant that basically only does a single thing. They do it really well, focus on absolutely nothing else, and it's great. That's the Soupman.They don't have anywhere to sit and barely even have enough space for a line to form. They sell practically nothing other than 8-10 daily soup varieties (there is a single sandwich I haven't tried yet). They don't really care about presentation or customer service. But damn do they make good soup.The soups are rich, thick with quality chunks of ingredients, and deeply flavorful. This has been true for the potato bacon, the jambalaya, the lobster bisque, and the tomato bisque. They're just very strong. Every soup also comes with a piece of bread, a fruit (I've usually gotten a banana) and an Andes mint. It's a good value for the money. I plan to come back here many times.\n",

      "Best deal for lobster rolls you can get in midtown and many other places because it's takeout-only. Storefront is very no-frills and if I just passed by I probably wouldn't give the lobster rolls a second glance, but I've read about them on google maps and wanted to give it a try! The lobster is good quality and they make sure to give you some claw meat as well. Buns are nicely buttered and toasted, and the meat has a nice touch of cold mayo. Best $17 I've spent in a long time :)\n",

Each soup comes with a piece of bread, fruit and chocolate. For chilis I like to add on cheddar and sour cream for an extra ~$1. Great quick lunch or a little snack while in the city.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Good variety of soups and reasonably priced. Soup is always fresh, you order the size you want, and it comes with a fruit and piece of chocolate. No seating at this location so you just order and go on your way. The lobster roll is also a good value, it's cheaper than Luke's Lobster but of course not as good. Would come again for the soups.\n",

      "Soups pretty goodCould be betterCould be biggerWhat I love is the little touch of a piece of bread and a treat you get along with each bowl you order;The small is super tiny. Should be illegals to call it a small; 6 bites and you're done. Large is still really small.  Jumbo is your average regular sized soup....  That's sorta the scale you're working with.Place had a cool vibe just leaning on the old Seinfeld nostalgia.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Yes! This is the place. This is the one you've seen on Seinfeld. Well, the place is not the same but the guy is and the soup is.We tried four small soups. All were very good. The lobster bisque is not the creamy kind you find in steak houses, but it was delightful. The split pea and ham was my favorite.My wife had the Italian wedding soup and the shrimp, corn chowder, which we both thought was unbelievably good! That was the best soup of the fourYou wait outside in line to order your soup, and then take away to eat. Nothing fancy, but the soup is pretty good. You've probably had better but not at a famous place like this.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "This is a store front, street corner type of place. They move fast and are not especially social with the customers. The lobster roll was extremely tasty, very expensive and very small. I was very disappointed when I received it. There is no place to sit so I bought a treat across the street so I could sit at their outdoor tables. I would not return to this particular eatery as I simply didn't get my moneys worth. Your mileage may vary.\n",

      "I was watching a clip on TV today and someone was making lobster biz, I longed for the days of being able to pick up suit man any day of the week. Fast forward to this afternoon I saw the original store was still open as I passed to go to a show! I was so excited I was gonna come back but I already know it's lobster best from the soup man it will be gone after this show is over. I got my regular small, paid and left. Follow the rules, lol. It still has the  same flavor after  all these years and I got  fruit  in the bsg  as well. I will I  bought  a large, I'm craving  it  now.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I've been to this place dozens of times since the 90's when Al was running the show and the line went around the block.  Everything was amazing.  The variety and ambiance were true to form in every way including the attitude of keeping the line moving.Then the dark days of franchising hit and Al moving on to the business side.  The quality suffered (like watered down soup). This location just became another franchise and was fair at best.To my great surprise on this mid 70's November day I saw this was still open (all of the other franchises closed years ago). I walked up (no line) and saw a similar setup of 3 cooks in the back and a friendly server in the front.  The prices looked to be the same and they did have lobster bisque which was my favorite.  I decided to gamble and get a small.  I strolled to Central Park and was amazed to find the soup was as good as the olden days.  No skimping on the lobster and the flavors were the same as I remembered.  All of the \"fixings\" were included too.It's strange for me to call this a hidden gem, but I guess enough time has gone by.Hit this place up and find a public area with seating (it's only a storefront) and enjoy!\n",

      "The soup's on! I recently visited the Original Soupman and was shocked to find out they had a vegetarian soup option that didn't come with a side of ridicule. It was a Butternut Squash soup, and let me tell you, it was so good, I wanted to scream like Elaine Benes. And for only $5? I felt like I was stealing soup. But that's not all folks, the Soupman even threw in a slice of bread, truffle chocolate, and a small pear! It was like Christmas came early and Santa was a soup genius. I swear I heard angels singing with every spoonful. LOL  The Soupman may have been tough on Seinfeld, but in real life, he's a soup hero.  I can confidently say that this soup was the closest thing I've had to a religious experience since the last time I watched a Super Bowl halftime show.  Just remember to mind your manners and follow the rules, or you might end up with no soup for you!\n",

      "I had the lobster bisque, which was good.  It included an apple, some bread, and a piece of chocolate.It was a bit of a trek to get there, and finding a place to eat the soup afterward wasn't easy.Since I had an evening of theater planned, I ended up going to some coffee shop and eating in there with a cup of coffee.\n",

      "The hype is real. The soupman makes the best soup. I've tried the wedding soup and the chicken corn chowder so far- both were insanely delicious. Love that you get a piece of fruit, a piece of chocolate and a slice of bread as well. Can't beat it! One of my fav lunch spots in NYC.\n",

      "I love soup so of course I was going to try this classic spot while in NYC. It was raining the day I walked up so there wasn't a line. The front person was really nice and gave me time to make my choice, going with the Lobster Bisque and the Chicken Corn Chowder. The price seems fare for the city and because it came with bread, apple and an Andy's mint.The bisque was my favorite of the two, rich flavor and large pieces of lobster. The corn chowder had a lot of thick ingredients but it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.Totally worth a pass by when I'm the city!\n",

      "We came here because our friend watched Seinfeld and heard raving things about it. It was only one guy working the counter, and on the door was a big sign saying that they are known for the lobster roll. So of course, we ordered the lobster roll along with the lobster bisque. Unfortunately, besides the fun name recognition from Seinfeld, this place falls short in every other way. The lobster roll was $14 (cash only). We get that lobster is expensive, but the sandwich itself was puny. The lobster itself tasted like defrosted frozen lobster and lacked the characteristic \"sweetness\" that I've had in high quality lobsters from high end places. In fact, it was underseasoned and lacked any sort of flavor. The texture itself was also a little bit rubbery, as if it was overcooked. It was very light on the mayo/any other sort of sauces, and there wasn't really any masking flavors that the lobster can hide beyond. The disappointing taste came through very clearly. The bread itself was kinda good, but I think it was just butter and bread, which would taste good basically no matter what. The bisque was cheaper and came with bread, a small cookie and a banana. Unfortunately, it was almost as disappointing at the lobster roll. There wasn't much lobster meat in the bisque, and whatever meat there was in there was dry, rubbery, and tasteless. It was not creamy at all, so similar to the lobster roll, it could not hide behind any other flavors. It tasted overwhelmingly like disappointing low-quality meat. I think I've gotten Costco lobster bisque that I've enjoyed more than this. Overall, this was not a pleasant experience. Perhaps the other soups are tasty, but from our experience, you probably would want to avoid anything with lobster from this place. 2/5 stars.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Been looking forward to trying these soups for a while and they did not disappoint.Tried a middle size of the Lobster Bisque and New England Clam Chowder. Got a piece of bread and a banana with each item. Both soups were thick and flavorful. Decent chucks of lobster in the Lobster Bisque. A solid spot for a quick and filling lunch.\n",

      "Obsessed with this soup! Im from Miami so we have some of the best cuban restaurants and let me tell you this felt like home. This was the cuban black bean soup- had corn and veggies and full of flavor. The temperature of the soup was perfect for the weather and the staff is so sweet. My friend got the buffalo chicken and finished it in one second. 10/10\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So so tasty. Service is simple as it's a walk-up window so don't come looking for a table to sit at. That being said, Central Park is a quick couple block away so you should be good. Chicken Noodle was flavorful and chock full of everything. My wife had Lobster Bisque and it was so good. Soups come with bread and an apple. Highly recommend this place.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Touristy, but honestly I need the medium or large size to actually get full. Their soups are filled with flavor. However, they are almost twice the price of Westerly's Health Market. Individuals will be the judge of it is worth it. I paid almost like $14 for a medium chicken corn chowder. Also, there is a charge for using credit card vs using cash. Another con against them. They do give fruit, bread, and a chocolate with your soup. Depends on individual if you think it is genuinely worth it.\n",

      "I knew I came to the right spot when I saw the Seinfeld references and images to the classic Soup Nazi episode. Asked them what their most popular soup was and he replied with the lobster bisque. No further questions asked - requested a small bowl of the lobster bisque. It was quite delicious and because we ate it outside in the cold rainy weather, it tasted even better. Only real gripe is the price. For soup, it's quite expensive. But then again, everything is inflated at the moment, especially at NYC.\n",

      "Man I really wanted to like this place more than I did.Not a Seinfeld fan, so I had no idea this place was a thing in the show. But the signs advertising a mouthwatering-looking lobster roll and accompanying soups has me anticipating a visit here for awhile. I got the lobster roll and clam chowder, and they packaged it up nicely since this place is basically a little storefront with no indoor seating. The soup even comes with bread, a little apple and a chocolate. So cute.But what I couldn't get over...A. The lobster roll, while awesome, has a little bed of hidden shredded lettuce you can't see at first glance. This may not mean anything to most folks, but I came here for the bare-bones lobster roll, claw meat on a bun with mayo and I was not expecting the lettuce, which took away from the experience for me, as someone who seeks out lobster rolls. I literally spent my time picking it out so I could enjoy it.B. The clam chowder is chock full of hunks of red peppers and stringy carrots. I almost wondered if they had given me the wrong soup when I took the top off! As someone who seeks out clam chowders, I have NEVER come across one like this, and I can't say the additions were for the better either. I expect my clam chowder to be full of fat chunks of potato and clam pieces, maybe some chives or bacon bits thrown in, but not this extra stuff that I navigated my spoon around, looking for evidence that there were indeed essential clam chowder ingredients.I do expect to come back and try the lobster bisque, for experimental purposes, but I can't ignore my disappointment, as I expected this would be a regular spot for me, but I am glad I at least got to try it since it's such an iconic spot.\n",

      "No soup for you!Anyone who is a fan of Seinfeld knows this immortal phrase. It's such a joy to know that The Soupman is alive, well, and also a real business still operating in NYC. Even though it's been disgustingly hot and humid I sometimes crave a good soup for dinner. On 55th street located not too far from the 57th street subway stop you'll find this small open front biz doing a brisk business even on these dog days of summer. It's a small spot just for grab and go, but my soups and accompaniments were packaged nicely for travel back home. The day's daily soup choices are listed on a board. On this day we had the Italian Ravioli and Vegetarian Chili. Both were freaking delicious! What's even better is that both soups come with tasty bread, a fruit, and piece of chocolate. A complete meal!Pretty cheap for what you get at $7- $8 for a large size soup, and they are filling. There are usually 9-10 types of soups available, toppings, and even a lobster roll here.No soup for you means more soup for me!\n",

      "This is the \"No Soup for You\" place. However, what you'll experience is vastly different. A truly welcoming walk up experience with a simple, straight forward menu. Did not try the lobster roll but the soup selection was varied and it was decently good soup. We got it on a cold day in December and it hit the spot to warm up. The bread and mint chocolate included were a nice touch as well. Is this a place where the soups will truly blow you away? Not from my experience. Is it still good and worth trying for any Seinfeld fan or someone looking for a warm meal? Absolutely. Note: there's no place to sit and eat but it seems common practice to utilize the strategically place police barricade as a makeshift table.\n",

The difference is in the freshness of the lobster. Really doesn't need much to make it tasty; glad they recognized that! Only the slightest amount of paprika is added to the meat.All soups come with bread, fruit, and chocolate.

Filled with all the good things you want in a soup. I got the Lobster Bisque ($10 for a small) and it was brimming with lobster meat and lots of other good stuff. It tastes great to boot.

I've definitely had better elsewhere, especially in Boston or Maine. It came with a piece of chocolate and an orange. Weird combo, lol. The lobster roll itself was $15 and although smaller than I expected, was pretty good, probably because of the butter. It lacked fresh flavor.

Lobster roll was small, maybe about 5\" but filled with chunks of lobster. It was good but not my preference. We each had our own favorite and all agreed the place will be a repeat. So the next day, we got the lobster bisque, tomato bisque and Italian wedding soup. I can say that all the soups were good so it just depends on which you prefer more so have to try them all to come up with a finalist.

      "I'm not a soup fanatic however there are some creamy soups that I love such as Loaded Baked Potato Soup, Lobster Bisque, and New England Clam Chowder.My Hunny picked me up a large Lobster Bisque soup to accommodate my diet. My meal came with an apple, bread, and a Lindt Milk Chocolate ball. I couldn't believe that my soup was considered a large. The container was awfully small. Albeit the soup was good, I've had better. I'd definitely pass on the extra side of sodium included. After each bite I found myself getting thirstier and thirstier. Soup shouldn't taste processed. I would've appreciated if the consistency was less watery and on the thicker side. Also the soup to lobster ratio was off.\n",

A few of NYPD's finest bought some soup getting ready for New Year's Eve.I went with the jambalaya (small size) and it came with a banana and nice fresh roll.  The small was actually good-sized and perfect for one person.  With the fruit and roll, that's a good deal, especially so in New York where a bagel might cost you $45 in some places.The soup itself was hot, loaded with sausage, had a good amount of heat, and was delicious.No sign of the \"Original Soupman,\" of course, but I believe he's long gone, at least from the stores.

Each soup comes with a piece of bread, a Lindtz chocolate, and a fruit (I got a banana). Eat the chocolate right away or it melt into a mess. I had the jambalaya soup, which was a first for me so I have nothing to compare against. It was slightly spice and very hardy with a lot of meat and rice. It was very good and pretty filling.

There was plenty of potatoes, sufficient clams, and it was thick, but flavor-wise was off for me. Same for the lobster bisque. I tasted more vegetable flavors than seafood. The cup container of the wedding soup leaked so badly that it fell apart, seeping through the bag where we had to throw it out and the torn bag. So never tried that one. Waste of money for me.\n",

It's literally a stand open to 55th St with an awning. That said, the staff here are fast and the soup really is delicious. Prices range from about $7 to $13 for a single serving of soup, depending what you get. Soup comes with a big slice of baguette, a chocolate, and a piece of fruit. So far I have loved everything I've gotten - the Italian wedding, the jambalaya, the lentil. The lobster bisque and the lobster rolls are what makes them famous, well, and Seinfeld, but I haven't tried them yet.For a Midtown lunch, its pretty good as long as you have somewhere to go to eat it. Portions feel a bit more substantial than Hale and Hearty, which is ironically spitting distance away.\n",

It's not to far from Times Square and by the theatre district. You want a quick bite to eat on the go this is it. I ordered the lobster roll $16+ tax and a small lobster bisque. I did kill both of them they had flavor. The roll was made with lots of fresh meat. For the purchase point it is on the smaller side with lettuce at the bottom. The bisque on the other hand was a little bit salty. Yes it has a little more additives in bisque then I prefer but it did not take away the over all taste to me. Will I go back? Yes it was edible and filled my stomach plus a great location.\n",

I'm from the south originally and I can tell you the Jambalaya tasted authentic and my son said the enchilada soup blew his mind because it literally tasted like enchiladas in soup form (since we live in Texas, we kinda know enchiladas). There is no seating around but if you go the 57th & Columbus Circle station there is an under ground food court with tables there that's perfect for enjoying your meal and maybe doing some additional shopping or eating. Oh, and the Seinfeld connection is cool, but there was no yelling or hazing over soup...\n",

Just a regular soup stand, I would assume, as I've never been to another one and that is because I still do prefer to eat my soup sitting down. My friend, having never been to NY, wanted to try this place because of that \"Soup Nazi\" episode in Seinfeld. We ordered a Lobster Bisque to share and went on our way. For whatever reason they didn't bother including utensils in there, so we had to go back for those. There was bread and a Lindt candy in the bag too. The bisque itself, while had a few good chunks of lobster, was ridiculously salty. I felt like it wasn't worth my time or money.\n",

Both soups were delicious with a banana and a piece of whole wheat bread included. The price was very reasonable ($6 a cup), service was good and the soup was like nothing I've ever had before. Not your typical Panera Bread or Cosi soup. The shrimp corn chowder was rich, creamy and flavorful.

I can heartily vouch for the split pea with ham, which was divine. I will say this, however: Yelp has The Original Soupman as a $ establishment, but honestly I'd like to suggest they bump that to $$. The XXL cup really amounts to an actual mom's-kitchen-sized bowl of soup, and $11-$15 for a bowl of soup (even soup this tasty) feels closer to $$ or than $. No hard feelings, though.I meant to include a photo with this review, but the damned soup was so good I wolfed it down before I could snap a picture of it. It was green.\n",

      "As a self-proclaimed #1 fan of everyone's favorite 90s sitcom, Seinfeld, how could I not try this place! If my memory serves me right, the small is 8 ounces and the large is 12. Given my familiarity with the soup nazi episode, I was pleasantly surprised when the cashier helped me decide on a soup and did not charge me $3 for bread. They also let you pay with card. Ordered the shrimp chowder, which is pictured, lobster bisque and jambalaya. As one that does not generally partake in spicy foods, I immediately noticed the real fire to the jambalaya (though not overwhelming, even for me). I did not think the lobster bisque was over salted like many other reviewers have described, but everyone's palate is different. The soups were filled with large morsels of their respective seafood - I even had a piece of lobster the size of a golf ball (though it was a bit chewy, indicative of being overcooked). I really loved the extras that come standard with the soup - bread, fruit (got a banana) and a bite-sized chocolate. The soup is pricey for soup, but what you get isn't chinsy - hefty portions of seafood, meat and veggies. Now I have something to look forward to this winter.\n",

      "Two words - lobster bisque. It's amazing. I didn't want to fall for the hype, but it's really THAT good. Some bisques can be too creamy, but this is just right. And the chunks of lobster are really bigger than normal. This place is takeaway only, so there's no seating. But it's a great place to stop by for lunch. It sometimes can be a line and a bit of a wait, but this place IS kind of famous. I tried a lobster roll, which honestly wasn't that memorable, but if you don't try anything else, definitely try the lobster bisque!\n",

Roles were reversed where I was receiving small talk which I didn't care much for. I ordered the medium sized jambalaya soup and Al's famous lobster roll. I knew to expect small quantity at a high price going in so I was not surprised. A jambalaya dinner is certainly better than Jambalaya soup but I was able to enjoy some of the elements of the dish. The lobster roll was fine which was on not too fresh bread. This was definitely a tourist stop and I can be glad to say I did it once.\n",

I've been here twice because I'm a big Seinfeld fan. How accurate is the Seinfeld episode (Season 7 episode 6)? -/+ Are they scary? Both times, they were unfriendly, but not scary at all. People do line up in a rather orderly fashion (as depicted in the episode).  - Is the line that long? Both times, I only had to wait for (no more than) 5 minutes.- Would you have to sit down because the soup is so good? I had one of their best sellers, the lobster bisque (the other being jambalaya). It was really good, but you can eat it standing up fine.- Would you have to pay for bread (if you forget to order it with the soup)? Bread is in a plastic bag with plastic utensils and a Lindt truffle, and they automatically put it in your bag. So, no.Lobster bisque:Good flavor with generous chunks of lobster meat. $10 for small (8 oz) and $12 for large (12 oz). With the flavor and the lobster meat, I think the price is reasonable. Other soups are cheaper.N.B.: It's a soup stand. So, there's no place to sit and eat the soup, nowhere nearby.******************************If you found something useful in my review, please hit \"useful\" so that I can improve my reviews.

      "Really good soup. I didn't experience any of the poor customer service that some reviews that I read had. It is just a walk up window though so it is not somewhere to go sit and eat.  I had a lobster roll and a small potato bacon soup.  I had heard mixed reviews on the lobster rolls, but here is my take on it.  Yes they are really only $12.  No this is not the amazing deal it might seem like.  They are relatively small lobster rolls.  I thought they were stuffed with a good amount of lobster compared to the size of the bun, but when you go somewhere else and get a lobster roll for $20 it is a meal that will fill you up.  This is definitely closer to snack size or a good add on if you get a cup of soup.  Be aware that although the pictures don't show it they do ph mayonnaise on the rolls they just put it on the bread right before they put on the lettuce, so it can be left off.  Now for the soup.  The potato bacon was nice and creamy and loaded with bacon! They did not try to cut costs on this one.  The lobster bisque was the same. Lots of large chunks of lobster.  The jambalaya was delicious as well and had just enough spice that it was full of flavor but not overly spicy.\n",

I sampled the other soups and they weren't comparison to my bisque!! The soup came with bread and an orange. All visitors must know, there is no place to sit and eat your delicious soup.

In a city that charges $8 for a small soup at the best of times, this is EXCEPTIONAL value.And what's more? It's delicious - best potato and leek soup I've ever had.

      "\"This better be good,\" I grumbled as I eyed the line of people on a Saturday afternoon. Upon looking at the $12 price tag for a medium Lobster Bisque, I thought to myself \"Whole Foods is four blocks away and their bisque is literally half the price.\" Nevertheless, I stuck to my guns and waited to try the famed soups of Original Soupman. Wow, was I happy I decided to stay in line. This lobster bisque nearly blew my mind. There was a really strong seafood umami flavor in the bisque that was tempered by a gentle sweetness that might have come from bell peppers? I'm not sure what the secret is, but keep it coming please! There was a fair amount of lobster meat distributed throughout the bisque so every sip had extra lobster flavor embedded. The wait was fairly short, and each order comes with an apple, a Lindt truffle, and a slice of bread.\n",

      "I thoroughly enjoy the soups here, but because of getting HORRIFIC food poisoning one time, I have to dock them 2 points, and that's being incredibly generous and shows how much I actually like the place. On a not too distant Sunday, I got a big bowl of the lobster bisque and was in bed that evening into the following day. I'd only had oatmeal in the morning and their soup for lunch before the series of unfortunate events. I should have known since they probably don't go through inventory as quickly on the weekends and for a soup relying so heavily on creams, it clearly wasn't the best choice. Although it still tasted great! There's no seating at this hole-in-the-wall shop, so I always take it to the nearby Whole Foods at Columbus Circle. When not causing IBS, their lobster bisque is tasty with nice chunks of lobster meat in them. The clam chowder is creamy and flavorful, with a nice briney flavor. They also give a bunch of sides, including a fruit, Lindt chocolate and piece of bread, which are nice add-ons. Their service is actually friendly, nothing like the Seinfeld episode its popularity is so famously intertwined with. I will probably still visit them, but with greater caution going forward.\n",

(Disclaimer: I am not calling anyone a Nazi...it is a character on the TV show \"Seinfeld\" for those who have never seen it.) I ordered my soups and while my food was being served and packaged, the owner gave me a little history about the store. It was very interesting and truly appreciated. Oh! I forgot!

I've never actually gone but it looked like one of the hole in walls where they serve the best food!I wasn't wrong.My friend wanted to get Pho with me but since she was running late for her appointment we decided to stop by the Soupman for a quick bite after a gym session.She ordered the lobster bisque. Now I'm not a huge fan of lobster but this bisque was super flavorful! There were a lot of lobster chunks and it was super filling!I believe it even came with an apple and a piece of bread but I could be wrong. If you're ever in the area, you need to stop by this place! If you're not, it's definitely worth the trip!Tip: There are no seatings.\n",

      "Move over crappy $1 NYC pizza slices! Here comes the $12 lobster roll!!! I was skeptical at first. Passing that sign everyday on 55th saying its Al's best but it really was good and better than most lobster rolls I've had to pay $30 for. A decent portion of lightly buttered lobster meat with old bay seasoning. On top of a toasted buttered bun with some lettuce and mayo. Not too bad and can't beat the price.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Overall really nice experience. Stopped by to grab a small soup for lunch. Went with the cheapest option, small tomato basil for $5. Also grabbed a bag of chips for $1. In and out, on my way. I was already pleased with the $6 lunch and very friendly service (midtown during lunch rush, quite rare) but when I opened the bag there was some Italian bread, what I think was an apricot or nectarine and a Lindt chocolate. Before I even tried the soup I knew I was taking this to yelp. Soup tasted great. Bread was good. Fruit was fresh. Definitely will be back. I've been eyeing that $12 lobster roll for 2 months.\n",

      "3.5 but rounding to 4. Love the lobster rolls here! Super buttery but oh so delicious if you aren't counting calories. I really wanted the lobster bisque but they were out, so I got the shrimp corn chowder, which was pretty average. Doubt I would get it again.\n",

Overall it was my first time there but I'd go back again if I was in the area and in the mood.\n",

      "\"The Original Soupman\" was my first meal in NYC. It was perfectly fitting, perfectly delicious, and exceeded my expectations.I ordered the Lobster Bisque. Like Elaine Benes, one taste and I needed to sit since my knees buckled at the amazingness in my mouth! Note that this is totally carry-out, so if you're not heading home or to a hotel, you'll have to find a curb, step, or bus stop bench to sit at.The soup was perfectly seasoned and included diced potato, celery, onion, (and garlic?) and BIG chunks of lobster. Seriously: BIG! I was impressed! It came with a slice of soft and chewy french bread, a banana, and a Lindt chocolate. The nice gentleman also gave me a free bottle of water! I'm a bit remorseful I didn't make a return trip for Mulligatawny - but so many NY eats, so little time! Definitely, though, on my next trip to The Big Apple!#nosoupforyou #soupforme #seinfeld #fangirl #Ilovesoup\n",

However there was no line whatsoever, and service was really fast and efficient.Looking forward to coming back and trying their signature lobster bisque and clam chowder! And probably I should consider getting a larger size as it was simply so delicious!!\n",

      "So on our way to Carnegie Deli, we happened up The Soup Man and I just knew we had to try it! After all, I expected a wait at Carnegie and after walking several blocks in the cold, a little soup to warm us up was just what we needed! As an avid Seinfeld fan, we knew the process but in reality the soup stand doesn't even have an indoor area like the show portrayed. You wait in line, you order on the right near the register, pay, and move to the left to get your soup. The gentleman in front of us was military and the Soup Man gave him a complimentary beverage. He was nice! We were up and we decided to get the small Lobster Bisque and New England Clam Chowder. Now $17 for 2 cups of soup may sound like a lot but I make soup at home and it's a process. The biggest surprise was that it came with fresh bread, an apple, and a Lindt truffle. We found an office building across the street with a courtyard and benches. We ate our hot soup in the cold and loved it! The Lobster Bisque was the best I've ever had. The Clam Chowder was good but not the best. Thank goodness I don't live in NYC or I would eat here all the time but I'll definitely return to try something else and the Bisque!\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The soup here is quite good! And they have a decent selection. What surprised me was that this was literally just a small open storefront with a small kitchen in the back. There are no seats inside (because there is no inside) or outside on the sidewalk. However, the storefront does have references to the Seinfeld \"Soup Nazi\" episode. Pretty funny. The service is excellent and the menu self-explanatory. I decided to try the lobster roll ($12) and the large lobster bisque ($12). The small was way too small and $10. I wouldn't say that the portions were that large, especially given the price. Definitely the most expensive soup I've had, but worth a try. It had large chunks of lobster in it. The lobster roll itself had multiple claws. The pairing with the buttered bread that formed the sandwich was awesome. It's similar to Luke's Lobsters sandwich.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So this is the soup place from the Seinfeld show! They have the picture of George by the side. He even has the footprints on the side walk showing that one must order, pay and move immediately to the far left. The soup was definitely worth it. I had the gumbo and others tried the lentil and Cuban black bean. The gumbo was very chunky with nice pieces of meat and the perfect consistency. The Cuban black bean was nice with a light after kick of spice with the perfect nod to Cuban food. Strongly suggest going during late afternoon to enjoy this place without the crazy crowd and observe the masters at work and take some pictures while you wait for your soup, each accompanied with bread, fruit and a chocolate.\n",

      "Whatever happened to the Soup Nazi, made famous on Seinfeld. In the day there was a line and the owner had attitude. Well no more soup Nazi, but certainly his under paid miserable staff has learned from the boss  only difference is there is no more line and the soup is average at best.We had the chicken dumpling and the split pea. I really don't mind paying the 18, but it taste like soup about of a canGabriel the worker hates his job and shows it\n",

Some people complain about the price but for $9 I had a large jambalaya and that came with bread, a giant orange and a Lindt candy.  I was very satisfied when I finished.  Plus, you're in midtown Manhattan. Stuff ain't cheap here, Jethro!Glad they are open on Sundays.  This is now my \"go-to\" place for soup in cold weather.  The toughest part is deciding which soup to choose!\n",

      "I used to buy their soup in boxes and frozen so I was super excited to see the store front. The soup is pricey but their selection is huge and very tasty. Must try the Italian wedding soup.

      "My first trip to NY in '02 was during the Spring.  The tour bus I was on drove by the 55th St. location and the guide said, \"For those of you who are Seinfeld fans, the Soup Nazi's store is located there.  It isn't opened right now, it's seasonal.\"Well shoot.So upon my '10 trip, I was hoping to meet the man, the myth, the soup nazi himself.  Mission accomplished bitches.Round 1 - Butternut Squash (small)-Came with mini banana, Lindt truffle and a slice of wheat baguette-Price $5.-Walked to central park, found a nice spot and ate away. -The soup was DAMN good.  Big chunks of squash and a good amount of ginger for some kick. The more I ate, the more I loved.Round 2 -Stepped to the front of the line and asked Mr. Soupman HIMSELF, what he suggested  (That's right, I'm people who KNOW people, people.)He also let me know that the secret to his butternut squash (which I gushed about) is the tangerine rind and honey he adds.  Brilliant!He was super nice and very very charming. -Lentil Soup (small)-same additions-Price $5-Super chunky and packed with veggies.  Very hearty.So basically, Seinfeld was right about the soup being amazing, but I found Mr. Soupman/nazi to be a very friendly guy.Lots of soup for me!\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Finally checked out this spot on a thunderstorm late afternoon. The store was empty, no customers waiting. So I ordered a lobster roll, which was $12. Quite fancy. The lobster was juicy and fresh, with lettuce and sauce. I like its favor.I had lobster rolls in the Plaza hotel($78 the Fitzgerald Set) and Luke's lobster($18). They are ok for me. But I always want to to find a spot which provide cheaper price and ok food.Happily I found it anyway.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "First off, they are a really nice staff. Lol, sorry.I had the lobster bisque soup with a lobster roll. It was pretty pricey, $24 total.The soup & roll are pretty good. They included bread, banana & a lindor....nice touch. Only con, there is not an area to sit. Just get your soup and go. Lol\n",
      "*********\n",
      "No Soup For You! Being a huge Seinfeld fan this was a must stop for me especially when I found out it was behind my hotel! Luckily the day I went was a bit chilly and the nostalgia of waiting in line and then eating outside on Broadway made my Seinfeld experience that much more satisfying. We tried the clam chowder and the lobster bisque both were really thick, full of flavor, and with lots of toppings in each. Each soup came with warm bread, desert chocolate, and an apple! Staff were friendly and even joked around about the Soup Nazi and the episode. A filling meal in itself definitely worth a try even if your not a Seinfeld fan.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Love the soup here. Yes, they may be on the expensive end of the spectrum, but it's worth it and much better than any of the other places that offer soup in the area. And that lobster... yea it's really good.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I love soup-- and this place really hits the spot. Despite being across the street from Hale & Hearty, they seem to be doing well! I got a small cup of the Jambalaya for $7 and it was delicious. Chock full of meats, veggies, and rice with the right amount of kick. It came with a baguette slice (super soft, so probably fresh?), an apple, and a Lindt truffle hahaThe two guys working there (on the Friday mid-afternoon when I went) were very friendly and conscientious (my hands were full so they were kind enough to rebag my soup into a baggie with handles without me having to ask).\n",

      "I hope I won't be black-listed...but yeah, this place is overrated imo!Hubby is a Seinfield fan and we had to stop by to check out the soupman during our visit to NYC...Hubby had the large chicken corn chowder and I had the beef& Barley... each set us back $9.... \"large\" is really no large... probably about 10 oz worth of soup...a good size for small stomach or for light meal. Each order came with a slice of bread, 1 Lindt chocolate truffle ball and a small apple.I liked the chicken corn chowder more than the beef & barley..but both really were just regular soup, nothing special and certainly not worth $9 for such a small portion. Sorry to say but it's just a small step up from progresson can soup....Soupman's soup probably had less sodium than progresso though.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Honestly I was drawn into this place cause of the lobster rolls and the price not Seinfeld lol. The service was fast and courteous. I asked for my lobster roll to be made with butter only just to be on the safe side since I don't like mayo. As far as the taste the celery taste was kind of strong and I had to fix it up to my liking a little bit more once I got in. I'm a lil picky about my food but I would definitely come back to try it again.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I've only seen one episode of Seinfeld and don't get the soupman reference, but I do like good soup and ever since I moved 10 seconds away from The Original Soupman, have been dying to try it. I finally picked up a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and a Lobster Roll last night for dinner. The soup is definitely pricey, but I guess that's because it's a pretty touristy spot.The Lobster Roll was good. I loved the big chunks of lobster and that they just used simple sliced bread, which made the sandwich more lobster than anything else. The clam chowder was decent, but no where close to mind-blowing or even top five places to go for clam chowder. I would've liked the soup more had there been real semblance of clam and more flavor. Perhaps I'll watch a few more episodes of Seinfeld before going back.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Found myself in the neighborhood recently and noticed the huge billboard near the tiny store front shop. This is it!  Ordered the New England Clam Chowder, medium. The 12 ounce cup was $9.00. Pricey, but I have been meaning to try the place, being a big fan of the Seinfeld show!  Quick and polite service, the cup was loaded into a bag, I paid and was on my way. The chowder was flavorful but thin. I also thought it would have had more solids at this price. The cup came with a nice slice of bread, an apple and a Lindt truffle (that was melted by the time I sat down to eat). Glad I got to experience the Soup Man, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to return.\n",

      "Not crazy about it.. food: lobster bisque ($12 12 oz) Good but not the best I have had. It wasn't loaded with cream so you could taste the lobster. Lobster roll ($12) on the small size but good at least. Bread was hot but the lobster was cold, so I made a nice contrast. Service: not friendly at all. I didn't hate it but I would not come back again, unless it happens to me on my way\n",

      "I stopped by here while I was hurrying to work, I hadn't looked up reviews before hand, I just saw this cute looking soup stand, I was cold and soup sounded good. I didn't realize there was such a hype about this place, but I have to say I completely understand! I got a 12oz shrimp corn chowder, and oh my GOSH!! This is without a doubt the best soup I've ever had! It came with bread, a chocolate and an orange, all for $9. Not a bad price at all in my opinion. The guys working there were very nice, and there was no line at 5pm on a Tuesday. I didn't mind the fact that there is no seating or counter because, as I said, I was on my way to work. There is a little park up a couple blocks with a ton of seating though you could go to if it's not too cold and you're looking for somewhere to sit. I'm really impressed with this place and definitely see myself coming back to try some of the other soups!\n",

I went with the shrimp corn chowder.  Lot's of shrimp and corn but I prefer my chowder to be thicker.  Most everyone else went with the lobster bisque and were extremely happy with the choice.  Definitely a must visit stop and worth the 15 minute wait.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Surprised there's not more review action here. Very simply, this a strong lobster roll for $12.I had no Seinfeldian rude service at all. The main chef/soup-guy actually checked in with me several times to say, \"The bun's toasting. It'll just be a little longer.\" and that kind of stuff.The lobster roll is cold fresh lobster meat  on a toasted New England bun with just a little dollop of mayo and some shredded lettuce. For $12, it has to be the cheapest lobster roll in the city. For my money, a solid option if you are jonesing for a summer treat that won't break the bank.Yay Soup Man lobster roll!!\n",

      "Two words: lobster bisque.  There are a lot of actual lobster chunks and the soup itself is creamy and flavorful.  No line at all when I went.

I like that you get bread, fruit and a chocolate but for $10 they can probably afford it :)Glad I went to knock off my bucket list but I don't know how often I'll be in the mood for $10 soup.

      "My favorite episode of Seinfeld is the infamous Soup Nazi episode, so naturally I made The Original Soupman (aka the soup shop this episode was based off of) my second food stop on my 2 day trip to NY with the Bae. Upon arrival, we were greeted by two gentlemen guarding 4 pots of the original soupmans soup.Food: Inspired by Newman, we ordered a small cup of jambalaya (I know, Newman would have ordered a large, but ballers on a budget ain't about to drop $10 on a bowl of fucking soup). The soup was hearty and chunked up with heaps of sausage and spices. The flavor was good not great, and a bit oily for my taste. The meal included sourdough bread, which is great for dipping and filling up your stomach, and a very aesthetically pleasing banana, which is great for force feeding your girlfriend in a humorous manner.Service: Unlike that infamous Seinfeld episode, there is no ritual to follow or emotionally unstable genius to navigate through in order to grab a cup of soup. Likewise, there was a distinct lack of line-out-the-door during lunchtime. It is unclear whether or not these two observations are related. Ultimately, my experience there was neither good nor bad: I asked for a sample, was turned down, chose jambalaya, and 30 seconds later, I was ready to eat. Clearly my life is not sitcom worthy.Verdict: Food was okay, Service was normal and unfortunately lacked any form of verbal abuse.\n",

Note, with my purchase came, at no charge...a Lindt chocolate ball, an (unripe) banana and good bread for dipping into the soup, all in a cute little Original Soup Man bag. This was super impressive to me. Next time I'll get there early, get the bisque and more lentil soup!!!\n",

      "This review is only for the lobster roll.The flavor was very underwhelming and the lettuce wasn't fresh.  I've had better from food trucks and restaurants.  There was only a handful of meat.  Finished the roll in under 2mins. So in conclusion, Stick with ordering soup, even if the $10 lobster roll looks very enticing because looks can be deceiving!\n",

      "so the obvious reason i came here is because of Seinfeld..duh...but the other reason is that it was friggin cold outside!!! my local friends opted to go to Hale and Hearty across the street (soup and salad spot...cheaper prices)...which was good..because there is no seating at Soupman..so i took my soup across the street and ate it with them.there were about 10 soups on the menu...3 sizes ( i think 8 oz, 12 oz, 32 oz) ...different prices for each soup.  the priciest being the lobster bisque (which i ordered)the cheapest being the potato leek (i swore i was going to come back and get this later...but i never made it)merchandisetees - $15soup mugs $15packages take home soups too..$20 for any medium soup + tee! nice! i wanted a tee anyways.my soup was amazing! i practically licked the bowl clean.  It had big chunks of lobster meat in it and it was creamy and delish.  I am so sad that I don't have access to more soup right now.  yum yum...i know it's a tourist attraction..but it stands up to the quality and taste.  San Diego needs a soup place (no souplantation does NOT count!)\n",

And you can get a lobster roll for only $10! Plus, it comes with bread, fruit, and a Lindt chocolate! Worth grabbing something to go, walking over to Central Park, and enjoying the Seinfeld-soup. When i went, the staff were really sweet. No need to be fearful. Just go.\n",

This place is a walkup random whole in the wall literally on 55th street. I ordered the lobster bisque soup and it was wonderful. It was rich and the lobster was delicious. My friend ordered a broth soup and loved it as well. The soup came with a fresh piece of Italian bread and a Lindor Truffle chocolate... nice touch. If you want some authentic soup this is the place to be. I cant wait to go back to see what else I can try!\n",

      "This hole in the wall is right around my office building and I finally decided to give it a shot. I wasn't sure what to expect because the giant signage in the area mainly talked about lobster rolls. Being allergic to shellfish, it never caught my attention until I finally looked up some reviews about it. Turns out their soup selection rotates prettt regularly and they offer a wide range of soups. $10 will get you a medium bowl of your choice, a slice of bread, an apple, and a piece of chocolate. Pretty good deal for the area, but could be cheaper. I got the chicken corn chowder. It was fine. It was partially my fault for not realizing that it wasn't a creamy/milk-based soup (what I was craving at the moment.)The guy serving up front was super friendly. Told me quite a bit about their history. Check it out if you're in the area.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Why am I just trying this??! I ordered the Lobster roll & a chicken tortilla soup on day 1. I really wanted the lobster bisque but I didn't want to od on the lobster. The lobster roll was petite. Definitely smaller than what I expected, and I've never had one before...but it was just right for me. It was soooo good. The tortilla soup was just ok. I've had better. The very next day I went back! Ordered another lobster roll but this time I ordered my lobster bisque...so glad I did, it was creamy lobster-y perfection! :) I will return.\n",

      "Bangin! The chicken noodle soup couldn't have been better.  Italian ravioli and broccoli cheese were great too. Different options everyday (and the price is right.) The lobster roll was fairly priced, fresh, and didn't have all that mayo that ruins it. Bread that comes with the soup could have been eaten alone, very fresh and a good crust. The fruit (orange one day, apples the next) and piece of chocolate are darling - such a nice top off! Will always get soup to go from here when in the area! FYI barely a line, if any, at all.\n",

      "Once again, the Soup Man doesn't disappoint. I got the large size of New England clam chowder. It's rich, not too thick, not too fishy. It's loaded with stuff, which makes it filling. What it's filled with, I have no idea, but there are definitely more than a few soft potatoes and clams I guess, but the clams aren't gross. Usually a lot of clams gross me out and they're chewy, but these clams weren't somehow. One fourth of the way there, I'm already really full, but I made a vow to myself that I will always get the large size, and I will always finish it. The best part about the Soup Man is that you're having soup for lunch, which in my opinion, soup is a side and not a meal. But whenever I'm done slurping up whatever's left at my desk like an animal, I feel more content and warm than before. Good apple also!\n",

      "This is the famous soup stand from Seinfeld, which is full of reviews from tourists, who were basically like, \"There wasn't enough lobster chunks in my soup.\" \"I expected more for $10 for soup.\" \"It's not hot enough.\" After reading all of these reviews, I'm expecting to get so ripped off. We were all wrong. I needed to see for myself if the Yelp reviewers were right or if they were just miserable tourists trying to be cynical to feel like real New Yorkers. Confidently, I ordered the lobster bisque. I didn't want to spend $10 plus tax on soup, so I asked for the cup. As the man took the cup, I realized that I'd need a large size, as I like to eat. I also read on Yelp that they give you a free slice of baguette, piece of fruit, and a Lindoor truffle for free. I cannot turn down a good bargain. I stopped him from pouring the soup at once to save the cup (and therefore, the planet), and I asked for the larger size. Now, I was stressed because he could now tell that I am a new customer.I didn't see him pack my bag with the bread, apple, or truffle, so I wasn't going to go down without a fight. I peered inside the bag to check, and lo and behold, it was all there. A smile grew on my face, and I looked at the man with pure joy and gave a nod of gratitude before walking away. He nodded back, as he could probably tell I was stressed, and it's not his fault he's so discreet. I was as happy as a clam (more like a lobster!!) and couldn't wait to get to my desk for once to devour everything inside my bag. Not only is this a good desk lunch, but also it's delicious. There were chunks of lobster in the creamy, mild broth, so every negative review could not be more wrong. I scooped up an entire claw of lobster meat at one point. I now want to try every flavor of soup here. This won't be an easy feat, as they change flavors daily and only keep some favorites on the menu, like the lobster bisque. I will be back for more. I mean it.\n",

      "Worst part is that there is no seating and the sandwiches are poorly presented ...Best part that it's still delicious, it's 10$ per lobster roll still not as good as Luke's but quite close thou, It will def satisfy ur lobster cravings in style...They give u a Lindt chocolate with the lobster bisque soup\n",

And we saw this little door open there was only one person inside making everything but he was quick. We got lobster bisque and a lobster roll. Both of them were great. The lobster roll actually has a lot of lobster in it and it was only $12 if I remember correctly. If I walk by again I will get something again.\n",

      "I saw a photo of Seinfeld outside this place, and realized this may be the Soup  place in the show!? I had to give them a try. It is a pick-up spot only, no seating. They told me they change up their menu every day, so they didn't have clam chowder that day. Instead, I ordered the lobster bisque. The customer service was friendly, informative and they packaged the soup so well. It came with a banana and a piece of lindt chocolate. The soup wasn't the normal creamy lobster bisque. It was very wholesome - with veggies and real good pieces of lobster in it. I love that they were not at all stingy with the lobster pieces, there were a good amount in the soup! But if you prefer the creamy lobster bisque, this isn't for you - \"No soup for you!\".\n",

I guess after several years in business, with the show's fans getting older and moving away, things slowly die out as well.The lobster bisque's full of flavor, going on the salty side.

      "Great hearty soups!  What more to say!   Service was prompt and fast and the soup warms you up from the inside out! The lobster roll is also just total goodness though it's a tad on the small side.Jambalaya was hearty and the sausage had a little spice kick to it. The lobster bisque was well balanced, hearty and had a nice creamy sweetness. The bread it comes with is great to soak up the soup.  And the apple and chocolate are just a nice cherry on top of everything.\n",

Very flavorful and very delicious.Slightly pricey and slightly salty but otherwise very satisfying for a chilly afternoon.\n",

      "NO SOUP FOR YOU!!!Apparently this place lost its hype because aside from a few people each time I went, it was not too busy. The Seinfeld episode made it look larger than it is. The people I saw there (myself included) took pictures like crazy LOL.Sadly the soup nazi wasn't even there. It was just couple of Hispanic guys who were nice. For $12 I ordered the large lobster bisque yadda yadda yadda- the large is a whole meal size portion IMO version the standard size just below it is better if you have something to eat with it. The second time  was there-same thing with who worked there but there was an extra person there who looked like he could be related to the soup nazi!The soup was served with a small slice of bread, a small apple, and 1 Lindt truffle.Add that with a $1 can of soda bought from a souvenir shop, you have yourself a great lunch. Find yourself a corner to lean or sit at that has no urine smell and you will have a great 20 minutes. I went back the second time hoping to find a tomato soup but that didn't have that either day. In any case, the lobster bisque is the best lobster ANYTHING that I have ever had and I normally do not like lobster. This didn't have that huge fishy taste that lobster normally has, and the portions of lobster were good.Would return =)\n",

      "The soup was amazing! My husband had the jambalaya & lobster roll.  I had the lobster bisque. We both ordered the medium but honestly I think the small would of been perfect too. Make sure you have your order ready before approaching. And move to your left after  There is no sitting so hope you find somewhere warm to sit and eat. If you are a Seinfield fan this is definitely on your bucket list to cross off.\n",

Friendly staff, and oh, this place has no seats and I didn't know where to sit down to eat. This joint is a store front shop with them taking orders in the front and prep in the back.I just had the lobster roll here and for $10 I thought it was too small and at first it just looked like a bun with some lobster and mayo. However, when I did taste it though, undeniably the lobster was fresh, bread was toasted, nice mayo and vegetable combination.Tasty? Yes. Would I go back again? Maybe if they were $5 each. :P\n",

      "I came here twice in 2 days while I was staying at a hotel across the street, that's how good it was. I wanted to come here because I love sienfeild but the soup is actually amazing. Kinda living up to the episode with the soup being so good. The soups aren't terribly pricey likes other people say. 5$ for a small and 7 for a medium. Medium was enough for me. My first visit I got broccoli chedder, very good and it came with bread, nice. Then the next day I got ravioli soup with a lobster roll for 12$ . I was worried there lobster roll wouldn't be good, I was surprised when it was great. Warm buttered lobster meat on a buttered roll, it was great. The ravioli soup was even better than the soup I had the day before. I will always return here if I'm the area. I'm such a big fan of  Seinfeld I was hoping they had the same soups from the show but they didn't on the days I went. They do change up soups everyday though.\n",

I'm not really a soup person but I was craving it and decided to try this place after it was recommended from my sister that it's definitely one of the best in NYC. And I was not disappointed. The chicken tortilla soup was good and it definitely satisfied my craving. My boyfriend had the jambalaya soup which he loved because they really knew how to put a bunch of different things in one soup and manage to make it taste so good. He also had the lobster roll, the lobster was huge chunks and it was good. The price is a little overpriced but definitely worth a try. It's fresh daily soup, can't go wrong!\n",

I asked for a sample since I am not too adventurous when trying new soups. The employee was completely rude to me and told me for 30 years he never gave anyone a sample of anything to anyone and that if I wanted a sample I should go to McDonalds and see if they give me a sample. Not only did he say that but by that time id expected my mothers soup to be served at least but instead he kept arguing with me while the other guy working was on his phone in the back. Now I have never known any place that doesn't allow you a sample of a soup. Dean and Delucas always gives me a sample if I request it and so does hot n crusty, Au bon pain, etc. This is a hole in the wall shop not a 5 star restaurant where I have to order and hope to like it. Well obviously I left and did not even get to get my chili but I say go to another soup place or at least a different Soup Man location.\n",

Not only that, but for just $5 I got the soup, the bread, a piece of Lindt chocolate and a banana.

Indeed there would be soup for me.  It's basically just a soup counter.  There were maybe a dozen different soups to choose from.  I passed on Elaine's favorite Lobster bisque and opted for the sausage gumbo.  Cash in hand, I settled up and moved to the far left to await my order.  There are signs hanging above in several languages that walk you through the process.  Clearly, the Soupman is one who takes things seriously.  My number was called and I grabbed my bag and was off.  No seating here.  Head a block north and there is a park with seats where you can have your soup.  The gumbo was packed with sausage and veggies, okra and enough spices to bring the noise and get the nose running.  So very good.  My order included an apple, a Lindt chocolate and bread, which was fresh and just perfect for mopping up the soup.  If I were local or worked in the area, I'd be here all the time.

The Soupman is a soup stand.  I guess I can walk and eat but it is raining so I am an trying to hold my umbrella. How do New Yorkers do it. They run back to their office? hotel? The park? hmmmmmmmm.I ended up eating  my soup bowl in a vestibule of an apartment complex. I ate fast looking behind my shoulder so that I would not bother anyone.

      "No Soup For You! is what you get when you don't order right; made popular from the Seinfeld episodes, not at these smaller chains though. I never been to the original one and when I first saw these chains of soup joints I didn't know The Original Soupman by Al Yeganeh chains are built around the reference to the soup restaurant from the Seinfled episodes. I only referenced it when I saw the slogan. If they had renamed it The Soup Nazi as named from the television show, then I would have recognized it but I guess that name is not Politically Correct.Oh, and as of right now, this stand is right across the street from a Hale and Hearty, which also serves soups, sandwiches and salads. What to choose from, oh the competition. I got both...I can't give an expert review on the Soupman because I have been here only once to try one soup: the Vegetarian Chili, unlike maybe a regular. The Vegetarian Chili was the top of two choices that tangled my taste buds. It was lightly thick and dark in color. It had a charred chili pepper and roasted tomatoes flavor, lightly sweet and rustic on the taste buds. The body of ingredients only included bits of tomatoes and beans, that's it! And, of course, the spices. I like the little package which included a fresh (soft, chewy and crisp) piece of Italian bread, a tiny red apple and a Lindt chocolate ball. Nice touch!The only down side is that it's a stand, no place to sit or if you need to use the restroom. Other than these tad notes, cool place with good customer service. They let me take my time to decide on my order and when I was ready they pleasantly asked and nicely gave a small comment after my order.

      "I'm tempted to write the quote that everyone else has in their review... but I shall refrain.I came to the opening of this Original Soupman location because I was so excited to finally try the famous lobster bisque!Ladies and gentlemen, it did not disappoint one bit. I think this is one of if not THE best lobster bisque I have ever had. Period. I've had lobster bisque at expensive restaurants that came nowhere near the same quality as that at Soupman. It has giant chunks of lobster and it's so creamy and delicious. I often get the small bowl for $8 which comes with a piece of fruit, bread and a chocolate. What a great deal!Seriously, the lobster bisque is worth it. Go get some soup from the Soup Nazi!\n",

      "This place might seem touristy because of the name but it's actually a great place to get soup! I live a block away, and it's a nice meal for lunch or dinner, especially on a cold winter day. My favorite is the lobster bisque because it is plentiful with delicious real lobster in EVERY bite. All soups come with fruit and a Lindt chocolate and a big slice of bread for dipping. They aren't rude like the origin of the name would suggest, really nice guys!\n",

There's more to flavoring then just adding salt!Perhaps I should have read the label first-Sodium - 760\n",

Lobster was tasty and there was a good amount. There was iceberg lettuce, however, which was a little off-putting. Nevertheless it was enjoyable, and an affordable little lunch.2. Lobster Bisque - $10, for a pretty small cup. It was good and there were definitely big lobster chunks, but I'm not sure if I'd order again. Came with a random fruit (apple!) and a random chocolate (a truffle!) which was cute. And helped the ten dollar price seem a bit more worth it.\n",

I did the menu a once over, but I already knew why I was here:\" Medium lobster bisque, please!\"\"$10\"Yes, it was overpriced...but the scent from the pot told me that it would be money well spent. They handed me my lunch with a smile and I ran back to the train to enjoy my soup at home...I couldn't get there fast enough!This creamy, coral colored soup is adorned with big big chunks of lobster meat. Not too salty and laced with just a tad of spices, this soup is perfect. A medium size kept me stuffed all day, so maybe I will just get a small next time.The bread was a nice compliment to sop up some of my soup and the Lindt truffle was also a pleasant surprise...I am saving the orange for tomorrow.I have had worse meals for $10, and this bisque was too memorable to stuff into my subconscious...Oh Soup (wo)Man...I'll be back for you!\n",

Well, I watched the dude make it, and he took out a sandwich baggie from the fridge, sprinkled some morsels on top of a tiny roll that he had just filled with iceberg lettuce, then gave it to me. Seeing that it cost $12, it ended up costing about $2 a bite.  And it was totally nothing special, either. I would have actually enjoyed the 99 cent pizza per slice place around the corner more (no joke -- the pizza there is quite tasty).To prove how tiny it is, I'm attaching a pic.

Got to the place and realized that this location doesn't have the sandwiches that the other locations have.  In fact, they only have one, the lobster roll.  A bit disappointed, and with only 15 dollars to spend, I decided to get one lobster roll ($10) and a small shrimp and corn chowder ($6). Okay, so added up that makes $16 dollars, but whatever. The lobster roll was delicious. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly toasted bun, and automatically came the way I like it, with lettuce, mayo, and lemon butter.  And for only $10 its about $5 cheaper than most lobster rolls in the city.I don't like soup, but I do occasionally eat it. For a place whose specialty is soup, I was really disappointed.  The chowder was just okay, no outstanding flavors, nothing special, just ok. Tasted like something you could buy at the grocery store.  The plus side is that it comes with a banana, chocolate, and bread.All in all though, I'd go back for the lobster roll.\n",

      "On a previous trip to NYC, I visited another location of The Original Soupman in Brooklyn. Yes, it was bigger and it had tables to sit in, but it didn't feel authentic.As a huge Seinfeld fan, this is the real deal. This is the original location of the Soup Nazi. I came here on the Seinfeld Reality Tour (led by the real life Kramer, Kenny Kramer!). It's just a small soup stand, but you can see the \"rules\" and a get a delicious bowl of fabulous soup. There's Seinfeld merchandise for sale too. The prices are high, but wow, was the soup amazing! We shared a regular sized bowl of the Lobster Bique. It was soooo good. The soup comes with a small piece of bread (it was hard unfortunately), a piece of fruit and a Lindt chocolate truffle. The experience is totally worth it. I wouldn't come here regularly if I lived in NYC, but it's a pretty amazing spot to check out if you're visiting, especially if you're a Seinfeld fan. The service was friendly unfortunately; the infamous rules weren't enforced. Also, there wasn't a line as previous Yelp reviewers mentioned. We did create a small line when our tour arrived though, but the line moves very quickly. FYI, this is strictly a take-away stand (like on the show).\n",

      "I have been living in the area for over 10 years and have avoided this place thinking of it as a tourist trap.  However, really wanting soup one day on the way out of the city, this happened to come up in Yelp.It's a soup kitchen literally - no seats just takeout.  People in other reviews stated it was pricey, I would agree if you get a medium (the 8oz soup) when the 12oz (large) is literally $1 more.  It comes with bread, an apple, and a Lindt Chocolate therefore I find it to be a complete meal under $10 for most of the soups = great deal in NYC.  Perhaps you think that is a lot for just soup but this is the city where just a plain regular burger can have a $15 start price.I didn't try to Lobster Bisque this time, but the Chicken Dumpling and Minestrone were both wonderful and warm for a cold winter day.Will be back the next time I am in the area.\n",

Given the overall Yelp rating I had to give this original location a try and based on both the Jambalaya and vegetarian chili I had on two different days this place is -- in one word -- awesome. Yes, the person behind the counter seemed grumpy. When someone asked if they had a particular soup and was told to read the menu it was funny. The bottom line, however, is always the food and unlike some other places that ride on other fame to stay in business I was glad to find out this was not the case for the Original Soupman.\n",

The lobster bisque was $10 for a small but they do have other soups at $5 for small (lentil) and some in between options as well. The server was awesome giving us his favorites which was greatly appreciated as it was our first time there. Soups included a piece of bread and a chocolate!

Nonetheless my partner in crime and I were able to happily sit down to an impromptu picnic of lobster bisque & jambalaya. The jambalaya was a tad sweet (probably from the tomatoes) and the bisque a tad salty, but nothing a good hunk of bread couldn't fix. Fruit was a nice way to clean the palate and cut through the indulgence of each soup and the lindt truffle (NOM) was a nice touch.\n",

Luckily, I had a $5 for $10 groupon because I would never buy something here at their regular prices. The small size is pretty small - I would say it is only about 8 ounces.I ordered a small jambalaya and a small mullagatawny. Each soup comes with a Lindt chocolate, a bread roll, and a banana. Considering the small size of the soup, those extras seem like add-ons to justify the price. They should instead increase the soup portions.The jambalaya was very good. It was thick and filled with generous amounts of meat, like shrimp, chicken, and andouille sausage.  I am slightly allergic to shrimp (makes my throat itchy) and I ordered this without thinking. I just avoided eating the bits of shrimp and I had no problems. I had no idea what mullagatawny was when I ordered it. I only chose it because Elaine on Seinfeld mentioned it! Well, it basically tasted like an Indian curry, with little bits of almond in it. It was okay, but if you are a fan of Indian food, you may like it a lot.If you are looking for the Soup Nazi experience, that is gone now. This place has been commercialized.

Not authentic southern gumbo with okra and the dark roux but it kind of has more of a NY style twist to it. I thought for boxed soup this was pretty damn good.

All soups come with bread, fruit and a Lindt chocolate so you won't have to go pretend you're a potential Lindt buyer when in reality you're only there for the samples... Please tell me I'm not the only one that does this. The only downside is that it's pretty expensive. You could probably go to a deli and buy a bigger bowl of soup for half the price.

The prices were a bit pricey for what you get, averaging from $5-12 for a large cup (get the large, the medium is more like a slurp). You get a bit of bread and a lindt truffle ball. Oh yea, there was also a sad little orange in the baggy. (altho it seems others have fared better or worse with their fruit)The soups were decent! Although small, they had good robust flavours (we got lobster bisque and clam chowder). After you eat a bit though, it tend to eat a little salty I think. Nice chunky soups though, with good substance, I just wished there was more bang for your buck. This is like sit down restaurant pricing...The service was quick but polite and they had no problems with groupon on my iphone. Good thing it wasn't crowded because we took our time with the menu but they were nice and even told us to make sure to order enough to use all the money Groupon was offering. Nice.\n",

I know everyone says it's expensive, but it's the same damn price as anywhere else.  Heck, I went to Bis.Co.Latte once and there soups are near $8.  Anway, back to the chowda'.  It was really good and flavorful.  Unfortunately, there were only two shrimp in my soup.  But the other ingredients were yummy.And, I got an orange, a slice of bread and a piece of chocolate!

      "Updating my review after going back many more times since my first visit.  I've tried crab & corn chowder and broccoli cheese, both were good but not nearly as good as the lobster bisque which is consistently awesome.  Now with a large they always give you fruit, bread (both of which vary every time), and a Lindt chocolate.  That makes the $10 much more worth it.  I only wish it also came with a beverage.They have also started serving lobster rolls for $10.  Here's the deal:- It's a lobster roll for only $10.- It is made fresh, and you can have it Maine or CT style (mayo or not).- They put a lot of Old Bay on it, and also some lettuce.  I'm not a big fan of the lettuce as far as taste on my lobster rolls, but the amount of it did not seem to reduce the lobster proportion which was still reasonable, especially for $10.- It's only $10.

      "Used a GroupOn.Stopped by for take-out on my lunch break and all of their Medium soups are $8 (the carton is SO SMALL!) and the Large is $10 (not much larger).Debated b/w the seafood chowder (tomato based) and lobster bisque. Chose the latter since the staff said that was most popular.I finished the entire soup bowl in less than 5 minutes. It included about 5-medium sized chunks of lobster meat. That part was delish but I'd rather go to Luke's Lobsters to fulfill any lobster cravings. Soup also included complimentary french bread slice and an orange.\n",

      "As a fan of Seinfeld I had to eat here on our NYC trip. The soup did not disappoint. Ordered the chicken tortilla soup and it was the best I've ever had from a restaurant. Every soup comes with a delicious piece of bread, a piece of fruit, and a Lindt chocolate. The soup man is a little gruff but thankfully he didn't ban me from the location for a year. If you like Seinfeld and/or good soup, it's a must visit in New York.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Ok, so being a big fan of Seinfeld and wanting some hot soup on a brutal cold day I ventured down to this location with a totally different image in my head.I almost walked right by the place as I didn't realize that it was a walk up counter and also didn't realize that the soups listed on the website wouldn't all be available each day. Since the place is totally outside there was no heat, and thankfully no line either so there was no wait. I wanted the chicken quesadilla soup but that wasn't available on that day, so I opted for the creamy potato bacon soup, as well as the lobster bisque. And we also tried the lobster roll. The price for the soup was decent for NYC prices, although I did feel that $10 for a lobster roll was a bit on the higher side for the size of it.So, to the food. The potato soup was bland, and some of the chunks of potato were firm and a bit on the crunchy and not fully cooked side. I couldn't find any bacon either. The lobster bisque was better, with more flavor. The lobster roll was small, with a few pieces of lobster with some really good seasoning on top, sandwiched in a large roll and a little bit of butter so the roll wasn't soggy.Definitely just a \"meh\" feeling about the original soup man.\n",

This place has amazing fresh soup and varies its menu from week to week while keeping a few reliable favorites like the jambalaya (other than people with shellfish allergies, who doesn't want a well made jambalaya?). Italian wedding is very fresh and authentic.  Potato with bacon brings a joyous tear to me eye, and the vegan lentil is hearty and delicious.  It's reasonably priced, especially for a good takeout meal in the city, and they give you bread, a piece of fresh fruit, and a chocolate truffle for dessert.  This is an awesome place.\n",

      "Awesome soups! We had the lobster bisque, clam chowder, and jambalaya. Each one was really really good! And they provide bread, chocolate and fruit with each soup purchase. A little on the pricey end for soup, but as a soup lover, I say it's worth it. There was a lot of chunks in the soups, often times soup maker skimp on the meat portions, but on the Soupman! I would definitely recommend the jambalaya and the clam chowder. As for the lobster bisque, you can probably find a better tasting one elsewhere.\n",

It's like how could you not love it!!? Also, what l loved most about not only this soup, but the others as well is that they're all thick and flavorful. In the corn shrimp chowder soup, there are well seasoned little shrimp bites paired with sweet, creamy corn and other veggies! It's overall amazing! The only thing that l dislike is that my favorite soup isn't on their menu everyday. Even still, l wouldn't mind trying other options! :)\n",

I take it back to the hotel.  For basically 10$ you get a large bowl of soup, bread, chocolate, and a piece of fruit.  Good lobster bisque, with potato, celery, and a cream based soup.  Hearty soup.  Could have been a little creamier.  Think NY version of a lobster bisque.  Not necessarily Seinfeld, but just soup in a large cup.  Minus one star, for no seating and the price.\n",

      "Came here to try the lobster bisque.  You order at the counter and eat elsewhere; the shop really only has a counter.  They take credit cards, which is great.  $12 for a medium lobster bisque gets you the soup plus bread, a piece of fruit, and a piece of chocolate.  As people have written previously, it's a decent bisque and the amount of food for Manhattan is pretty filling.  I'd be willing to return to try the lobster roll which is also rated highly.\n",

      "There's a reason this stand is legendary, and that it has outlasted any number of imitators: It's perfect. There is seriously no more perfect food on a brisk day than their lobster bisque. There are plenty of other great soups here (the seafood bisque and the corn chowder are especially fab), and that lobster roll looks delicious, but every time I walk up to the stand I am overwhelmed by my proximity to the world's most sublime bisque and can't imagine ordering both. Someday. Someday!\n",

      "I had the lobster bisque - very filling. It was very tasty but sort of cold and at $8 for a small I was kind of surprised by that. The bread it came with was very good and great for dipping. The fruit and chocolate were a nice touch, but overall I probably won't be back.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "My fav . It's a little bit pricey but they give you bread, fruit and a lindor chocolate. Now that's a lunch. Packed neatly like your mom did it with love. Soup is always fresh and there is variety for every palette. It is a takeout window, so keep that in mind. They are actually very friendly, no Seinfeld soup line attitude. I feel like I would eat it everyday. They also sell memorabilia if your a tourist.\n",

The soup was really, really good and would definitely order it again, though the other soups looked really good too.

      "I was really looking forward to getting a lobster roll and soup from here but when I got there at 2PM, lobster roll was already gone. I ended up getting a shrimp corn chowder. As soon as I ordered it, I regretted not getting the lobster bisque. Oh well. So it is true that the price is a little steep for a small soup, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the soup is flavorful and a good balance of soup and shrimp/corn/carrots in it. The piece of bread that came with the soup order is fresh. I got a little apple and a lindt chocolate as well. It felt like a healthy meal already! I can't wait to try to lobster roll. It probably won't be as good as Luke's but for $10, it could be a cheaper substitution. As the weather gets colder, I would be visiting the soupman for some good quality soup to warm up.\n",

      "Genius isn't pretty... but it sure is deeeelicious!  Who among us does not know the Soup Nazi?  I chose to review this eccentric take away place to be my 100th review, because... I didn't want to be predictable.  I have brass balls, but I have no qualms admitting that I was intimidated by each encounter with Mr. Al Yeganeh.  If anything, Jerry Seinfeld downplayed his dictatorial demeanor.  The strict protocol for placing your order and maintaining absolute silence while standing on line is posted in no fewer than 15 languages.  The kitchen staff, hustling wordlessly in the claustrophobic work space are eerily silent.  The Soup Nazi calls out your order, and the wordless staff fulfill it.  Cheesus, Mary and Joseph - we're New Yorkers - the most boisterous, bellicose, aggressive, in-your-face people in North America... standing meekly in a straight line, money in hand, quaking at the very notion of being dismissed from this institution!The crab bisque... really IS to die for.  You have no say in what else is handed to you in the nondescript brown paper bag; you'll typically discover a slightly stale baguette, a randomly assigned mediocre piece of fruit (apple, banana, etc.) and two or three Hershey Kisses.  The whole experience is very surreal: double decker tour buses pass by at regular intervals during your 20 minute wait, with the guide on a bullhorn, belting out, \"This is the famous Soup Nazi that Seinfeld immortalized in his sitcom...\" The location is nothing special: he's closed during the summer months, and opens as the weather changes and soup becomes more appealing; this information is disseminated by a piece of paper taped to the roll-up wall (think: auto body shop) and typically gives no actual date for his return.  Just a guesstimate.  But what can you expect from a Soup Savant?There is a bonus feature - pre-packed quarts of soup, so that you can enjoy the miracle of his madness in the comfort of your own home. Just don't try to pass it off as your own.\n",

      "The original soupman is awesome -- but his elves hired to work there, not so much. I've walked by there almost every day for the past year and as good as the soup is, I have only stopped there three times.  The first time, i walked by and given that I had never been there and the fact that they had like 20+ soups to chose from, I asked the caveman looking guy who worked there if I could try something.  Caveman said \"nope\" in the most abrupt manner possible, I actually thought for a second he was being sarcastic -- but when he didn't follow it with \"kidding,\" I immediately walked away and went to Hale and Hearty across the street where the soup was just as good but they have no problem letting you try stuff.  A few months had passed and by this time, the resentment toward rude caveman tapered off so I decided to give them another shot, everyone has a bad day after all and maybe that one day just happened to be his--understood.  So second time I made my visit because there were no lines -- just another bored, unhappy neanderthal-looking soup guy who look stared at me when I approached the counter (there was no \"hi,\" no \"what would you like,\" no \"how may I help you?\" just a cold, blank, \"nobody's home\"-type stare). I didnt even ask for samples and i was specifically craving a butternut squash soup anyway. Neanderthal was so careless and he poured the soup in such a sloppy way with the lid only half-closed.. at least a quarter of it leaked out by the time I got home.   For $7 for a cup of soup, I was expecting some decent service.  Although I was bitter and swore I would never return, my boyfriend was craving a soup and wanted to grab something there as we were walking by it a few weeks after my previous experience.  I warned him that the service is awful but he was focused on getting a soup.  We encountered yet another rude guy who looked like one of the characters from Where the Wild Things Are (same look, same story-- scary, unhappy,bored...) My bf asked if he could try something and before he even finished his question, Wild Thing shot him the same \"nope\" (first paragraph, same story, different creature).After my experiences here the with customer service (or lack thereof) and the half cup of soup I actually got to enjoy, here is the conclusion I came up with:  The soup is good, but given the terrible service from people who lack the ability to pour a soup into a cup and snap on a lid properly, you are better off at hale and hearty where at least the workers are much more accommodating (not to mention better-groomed), the soup is great and there are places to sit.  The soup\"creatures\" at the original soupman are in desperate need of a makeover, starting with their personalities.\n",

      "The authenticity and the thrill is gone. Cash in, sell out, and smooth out all of the rough edges so as not to upset your customers. Cater to the largest common denominator, be nice to the tourists, and make the most money. Barf...I used to come here for lunch 10+ years ago back when it was still real and you had to follow the rules or else risk the soupman's wrath. Yes, I had a friend who was banned because he didn't follow the rules and was talking on his cellphone instead of having his money and order ready. We were afraid to even be seen with him in case we would be banned too just by association. The soup used to be so good that we would practically get high off of it when we brought it back to the office to eat. You had no choice about what kind of bread you wanted (only white) or which fruit. It was a surprise when you opened your bag. Tonight I decided to come here since I was in the area and had heard the it had reopened and wanted to see if it was still as good as it used to be. It's not. I had the Seafood Gumbo and it was disgusting. Tasted like it came out of a can (probably did since it's now a franchised chain) and I spent a good five minutes trying to find the seafood and debating which bits might be the seafood. Scary. Oh, and of course, now you can purchase your souvenir No Soup For You swag along with your soup. Sad. Sad. Sad.Will not be returning. Would not even recommend it to a tourist. It's just wrong.\n",

      "Having seen Seinfeld and reading the website beforehand, I was very much prepared to follow the rules (which by the way are completely reasonable: pick your soup, have your money ready, move to the left after ordering- basically keep it moving). I quickly ordered a small lobster bisque and a small jambalaya, got my money out, and moved to the left after ordering. But the register is on the right! I just had to move right back to where I was. I told them I was pretty disappointed as I had totally prepped myself to follow the rules to the letter. Maybe someone usually takes your money at the left and brings it to the register, but at that point it's not really so efficient is it? Anyway, the soup itself was alright. The lobster bisque was very tasty. But the jambalaya was way off. I ate it on my lunch break and the andouille overpowered everything else, it was all I could smell and taste. I tried the leftovers a couple of days later and by then the flavor had mellowed a bit, but it tasted more like Manhattan clam chowder. I've had jambalaya soups before and I think jambalaya just doesn't translate into a soup well, but this was the worst I've had so far. I tossed the leftovers. Each soup you order comes with free bread, a tangerine, and a piece of chocolate. Which is very nice, but I would rather they skip the fruit and chocolate and just knock a little off the price. Those two small soups came to $15! Maybe people will think I'm crazy but I LOVE Hale and Hearty and would take them over Soupman any day. Plus one is right around the corner from here. I'd come back to Soupman for the bisque, if I was having a wicked craving and couldn't find it elsewhere, but that's pretty much it.\n",

      "The Original Soupman is apparently known to all Seinfeld watchers worldwide. Unfortunately, I've never watched a single episode of Seinfel so I have no idea what everyone's talking about. I decided to come here one day after work, seeing that there was a Groupon Now deal $12 for $20.As far as soups go, they serve much more than lobster bisque. You can choose from clam chowder, corn clam chowder, lobster bisque, and a couple of other ones that you'll probably not order anyways. If you want food, then they also serve up a lobster roll for $10. For those who want a deal, they have a tshirt/mug and soup combo. $18 for a large soup and tshirt or mug, or $20 for a large lobster bisque and a tshirt or mug. I wouldn't say that these prices are overly pricey since you're pretty much paying the same price at a restaurant, but in the end, you're taking these soups to go. Since this place is more or less a stand, service is fast with no frills. Go up to the counter, order, and get the hell out. Every soup comes with a slice of baguette, a fruit, and a Lindt chocolate. Not bad! The soup sizes vary, but a large soup is pretty much an individual portion. If you really wanted, you could probably polish off 1.5 large soups in one sitting. The clam chowder was mediocre, but the lobster bisque was actually pretty decent. There are chunks of lobsters inside which made everything much better. The soup isn't overly salty, and isn't waterly like crappy soups. The Original Soupman serves up pretty decent soups. Coming from SF, I'm used to seafood soups, so it's not foreign to me. This place is close to my apt, consistently has deals, and is fast. If it wasn't for the Groupon or LivingSocial deals, I don't know if I could justify spending $20 on soup. $12? I'm totally there.\n",

I got a large lobster bisque (most popular order) and it was delicious. I wish there were more chunks of lobster, but they were decent chunks of lobster to begin with. I'd definitely come by again.All orders get a piece of fresh fruit, a slice of bread, and a chocolate ball. Prices range from a small 7-9 to a x-large 16-20. It's a very good and surprisingly filling meal. My only qualm about the place is that it's a stand and there really no where to eat the food. Not even high table tops outside of the place.I ended up enjoying my meal in the hotel waiting area across the street out on the benches on a cold day. Up side, the soup is great for a cold day.

Got the seafood bisque (wanted to try the lobster bisque as all the yelpers suggested but they didn't have it). The soup line is different from the regular lunch items. Got the small for about $6. Midtown lunches never fall under $5, so this price is fair. The soup is so flavorful and delicious and has a good amount of seafood chunks! The shrimps aren't too rubbery or over cooked.Yes, the soup may be pricy but it's something you have to try once, especially if you're a Seinfeld fan. Just once, not 5 times a week (unless you're made of money).\n",

      "Two words: lobster bisque.  Just get a bowl.  Trust me (unless you have a shellfish allergy).  There are plenty of actual lobster pieces and the soup itself is creamy and flavorful.  I had the lobster roll with the bisque (we shared the roll and a bowl of the bisque) and it was a perfect, albeit pricey, combo.  The lobster roll was full of lobster pieces and almost as good as the versions that I have had in Boston.  A landmark, whether you are a Seinfeld fan or not (I happen to be one).  The Lindt truffle and fruit were nice finishing touches.  It's not a dine-in place but at least the line moves very quickly and, in all honesty, the food is good enough that I would not mind being forced to eat standing up (we actually brought it with us to have on the train).  The only detraction was the hard roll but its still good if you treat the bisque as a dip for it.\n",

      "Dissapointing. I love soup.  About 7 years ago,  I went to the Original Soup Man location at Rockefeller Center.  I loved it. Made a vow then to go there every time I was in NYC.  A couple years later,  the location closed.  It would be several years before I would make it to another location. This one was a fast food/quickie mart style counter near N Y Public library. It reminded me of buying a cup of soup to go at the Whole Foods hot food bar. Not awful. But nothing special.  I assumed it was mostly just that location.  Nope. The man behind the counter told me that this location was the original location,  made famous by Seinfeld.  Hard to believe. No place to sit.  No interest in the customer. Overpriced, salty,  lukewarm soup. To be fair: Not the worst Chicken Chili,  but nothing special.  Being New York City,  there are better options.....with seating....and cheaper.....and better customer service....and a better location.  I feel bad being so negative. But,  you want honesty,  right ? Try the Soup Spot.  I hear good things about them. Also, there's a Hale and Hearty Soup location almost across the street.  They have seating at least.  Actually,  though.  If you're in that neighborhood , you really ought to just go to Carnegie Deli.  THERE'S A WINNER.  :-)\n",

      "It's been years since I've been there, but I can still remember how awesome the lobster bisque was. Big chunks of flavorful lobster in the soup. The price was steep for a food stand. This was back in 2000. Nevertheless, it was worth every penny. The experience itself was just like in Seinfeld. I observed the owner scold some Japanese tourists that were holding up the line as they took some photos in front of the stand while buying soup. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the owner yell, \"no soup for you!!!\" That would have been hilarious. As my turn approached to order the food, I was a little nervous, and wanted to make sure that I got my order right. If the soup is still as good as it was ten years ago, it's definitely highly recommended.ps: I just saw on the other posts that the placed is closed? That's a shame if it's true. Sigh ...\n",

We came for amazing soup, and the fact it was on my boyfriends favorite show.... it must have gone downhill or something b/c it's not worth it. It's not even good soup. It's extremely expensive for just soup. it came with a crappy orange and a melty chocolate truffle. it's also 1.50$ for a CAN of soda. Lobster Bisque.... gonna start out by saying yes I know lobster bisque, I LOVE it, i get it everywhere that has it and I know great Lobster bisque....this is NOT IT. it's watered down. it's like broth, no rich creaminess like it should have. it has NO flavor (i added salt) and a few pieces of tiny crappy cheap lobster. and some celery? ew. I would never eat that again.B/f says the jambalaya was good but nothing special and not worth the price. he's why im giving this 2 stars and not one....Overall.... not very tasty (there are FAR better places, hell , half and hearty soups across the street is better than this place--and cheaper) its WAY to expensive for what you get, its not horrible but it's not good either. don't waste your time.\n",

It rivaled some gumbo I've had in New Orleans, not AS good as that gumbo but pretty close.\n",

      "(First to post on the re-opened store)Went today to try the Soup Nazi's soup. It is now branded with the SoupMan name. Ordered a small Minestrone. Came with slice of french bread (advertised with butter but they shorted me), a Lindt truffle and an apple, and they gave me a free a shirt for opening day. I ordered a bottle of water but they forgot that too. My fault for not checking. $6.50 for all of that. I think the price went up about $2 for medium, and $4 for large, but thats just my guess. Also-every soup is not priced the same.Among the soups for today were the famous Mulligatawny and \"JAMBALAYA\"The soup was great, very tasty. The bread was stale. The store is diagonally across from a Hale & Hearty, but I'd much prefer to go SoupMan. I've never been to the rest of the chain SoupMan stores, so I cannot compare it.The store is very efficient, there was a lot of staff in anticipation of opening day. There was no line when I went, but I heard there was around noon. Its just a window that you walk up to and place your order. The rules are posted along the ceiling in various languages. English is just over the register.Don't really have much else to say, besides the fact that HE wasn't there. Oh well. Hopefully one day I'll catch him. Oh, and they didn't yell at the idle girls in front of me to move to the extreme left--I knew better and moved my ass over to the left (and had my money ready).\n",

I wasn't even that big on soup before trying this place, but I LOVE THESE SOUPS.I've had the lobster bisque, the broccoli and cheese, the veal goulash, and the jambalaya.  My favorite was probably the jambalaya.  Still, every single one I've had was good.  They never stint on ingredients... I'm eating the veal goulash now and I swear my cup is half full of tender, flavorful veal.  I've never had the urge to add salt or spices - every cup has been perfect.I mostly choose one of the $5 or $6 small cups, which come with bread, fruit, and Lindt chocolate.  The soup is hearty enough that this is the perfect amount of food for me.  I'm convinced that the soups can't be that good for you because they taste so damn good, but whatever - I don't eat here to be healthy.  If you work around here, this is a bargain lunch, and great while it's freezing outside.\n",

What can I say, I was hungry. Very happy with all. Generous lobster pieces on a toasted roll with a little lettuce under the meat - nice touch. Bisque was good, not as sweet as some I've had but good with good chunks of lobster. Split pea with ham was the star for me with large sized chunks of tasty ham and tiny slivers of carrot. Also enjoyed the surprise of a piece if good bread, a chocolate and an orange along with my utensils for each soup. A full meal indeed.\n",

      "It's a bit of a toss-up between 3 and 4 stars.The soup is excellent. I say this as someone who doesn't usually eat a lot of soup (because most soup out there is pretty boring.) It's also a bit expensive. Mine came with a slice of what looked like decent bread (I'm gluten-intolerant, so I didn't partake), a Lindt chocolate truffle (milk chocolate, unfortunately), and... an orange? Seemed odd, but ok. I'd rather they skipped these extra things and given me more soup, to be honest. But I suppose the extras are a nice touch.\n",

Unfortunately, it was way below expectations.I had the medium lobster bisque and it did not taste like any other lobster bisque I've had and I've had plenty, ranging from Pike Place Chowder in Seattle (my favorite) to high end restaurants like Joe's Seafood. Firstly, it lacked the proper flavor and there were too many vegetables inside. To top it off, it was super pricey at $10 and the service was appalling; they were uninterested and slow. I understand it was a hot day and their job must be boring, but still....I have no idea why there are so many good reviews. But I know I am not coming back.\n",

      "Soup Nazi, \"No soup for you!\". I know I know, but honestly, it was right next to our hotel, needed a quick meal, Soup Man.I ate there twice. Lobster bisque and crab chowder were pretty good with an insane amount of seafood. Everything was good. Food came with a fresh piece of bread, a piece of fruit and small chocolate. All for between 6-8 bucks. Not the best deal in town, but fair for a touristy joint in the theatre district. Look at the menu, step up in line, order and get out. Both times I was in and out in under 2 minutes, and never got yelled at.\n",

      "I've walked by The Soupman almost twice a day since moving to NYC and was compelled today to stop due to snow and a nasty cold. The service was awesome. If there were separate stars for that, they'd get 5! I ordered the vegetable soup and was thrilled when they put a piece of bread, orange and chocolate in my bag. When you don't feel good, the little things matter!The vegetable soup has brussels sprouts in it. Now, I'm actually a fan on the snubbed baby cabbages, but I felt like they tasted strange in the soup. The broth was good, but not something I don't think I could have made at home. I think next time I go, I'll order the epic Lobster Bisque. I don't see myself ordering the vegetable soul again in the future.\n",

      "So today was the first time I finally ate there. I've worked in the general vicinity for more than a decade and I refused to subject myself to those ridiculous lines. Sorry, with thousands of fabulous choices in this city you will not catch me on a line of 20+ people waiting to order, like ever. However, I wanted to try something new from my usual lunch spots. I got there a little around 2pm and thankfully I was 3rd on line. Perhaps after all these years the lines have calmed down or I just got lucky. I ordered the Lobster Roll. The portion is about the size of NY hot dog. There where 4-5 generous pieces of fresh lobster. The buttered bread was so tasty and lightly toasted. I think the seasoning was perfect, just enough. The touch of the lettuce and mayo keep it simple and fresh.  I will definitely be back and I will try his soups next time. As for him not having a place to sit, its not that big of a deal. Just walk around the corner to the plaza that is on 56th & 8th Ave and you can sit outside of the Chipolte's. Its got a few trees and sufficent seats.\n",

Due to the number of posts that directly reference this dish, I decided to take a second swipe at the soupman before summating the soupman's stature.Today, I had the Tomato and Basil soup.  I sat down, had a taste, and my blood vessels constricted.  It was the saltiest soup I've ever supped.  In the interest of my continued health, I threw it out. Maybe I've seen enough one trick ponies to be impressed. The Lobster Bisque is delicious, but that's about all The Original Soupman is good for.  Well, that, and brusque customer service.My advice for the soupman?  *clears throat**withdraws bullhorn from under peacoat*Walk by, take a picture on your cell phone, and go across the street to Hale and Hearty. Not only do they have a bounty of delicious homemade soups, they make sandwiches too.  Their soups are better than the soupman. They take credit cards! There are places to sit!  There are more varieties!  No, it wasn't parodied on a TV show, but does that really matter?If this review means \"NO SOUP FOR YOU. COME BACK ONE YEAR\"...  I'm not going to be heartbroken.\n",

I knew what I wanted (lobster bisque) so it was a very quick, easy transaction. There's also a sign posted on their window that there is public seating about a block away.

The Lobster Bisque had plenty of lobster and some veggies.  It wasn't too greasy, was cremy, but still very soupy.  It was very tasty (but had a pinch too much salt).  I'm not big on having too much salt these days.  The Chicken Chili Soup was not my favorite and I probably would not order it again :o/With every soup, they give you a piece of bread, a small bag of fruit (some grapes and a strawberry) as well as a piece of chocolate that melted in the bag because it was next to the soup  :o(  The extras were a nice touch.The pricing is a bit higher than Hale and Hearty but if I'm in the area I would consider going there again.\n",

      "Judging by the soup alone, this place is amazing. I got the seafood chowder and essentially drank every last drop (and even thought about going back for a second cup). It was that good.However, everything else about the place is lacking. The soup is expensive-- $10 for a lunch sized portion. On top of that, there is nowhere to sit, so you're forced to either take the soup back to the office, or, as I did, prop yourself against a building and eat it standing on the street. A few small chairs and tables would have been nice.\n",

The lobster bisque had big chunks of lobster in it and had a really good flavour. Just as good was the butternut squash soup, which was full of intense flavour also.

      "The first soup I had here -- Italian Wedding -- was 'okay'. The second soup - Vegetarian Chili - was the absolute worst soup I've ever had in my life. It smelled and tasted as though it had been made from a base of apple cider vinegar - just vinegar, nothing else -- plus perhaps five black beans and shreds of some other mystery ingredient. After spending $8.00 for this lunch, I tossed it out after two valiant attempts to still try to eat it. It was horrible. Unfortunately, Soup Man has become a victim of its own success -- it doesn't even seem like they're trying anymore. Any nearby cafe chain provides more delicious (and edible) soups.\n",

The Soupman may have mellowed with age but that's no reason to complain about the soup.  Honestly, I don't want to get yelled at, I just want really good soup.  On a cold day, the creamy lobster bisque or the delicious gumbo will treat you right.  Good comfort food on a cold day...that's what we all need! You're just a few blocks from Central Park.  Grab some soup and take a walk, take in the cold air.  It's NYC baby, you're living!\n",

      "Delicious but expensive soup.We had the clam chowder and lobster bisque which each came out to $10 per bowl. Now for $10 a bowl, I was expecting a bit more in either quantity or quality.

      "I went here once years ago when I lived around the corner, and now that I work around the other corner and today is a particularly cold day I decided I wanted some soup, man! The potato leek soup was just not good--edible, but only barely. The consistency is slightly gelatinous and translucent. Rather than a creamy or simply potato-y soup base, it seems to be mostly water that is thickened by the potato (and/or something else?). The flavor is A-OK, but the consistency made it hard to eat more than a few spoonfuls. F on the soup. 0 stars.The lobster roll was good. It's not like the rolls you'll have in Mass or Maine, but definitely good--a few stars' worth. Still, the \"Soup man\" should not be selling that clear-jelly potato-leek soup.\n",

Creamy with big chunks of lobster and maybe celery, carrots, I'm not sure what else. It also came with a nice fat slice of white french bread for dipping. I almost didn't think I could finish but the soup was so good that I took a breather and ended up polishing it all off...I am only taking a star off because it came with a nectarine that was a bit moldy. Also I didn't really like the chocolate it came with - but I appreciate the effort to give you a well rounded lunch. Instead of those things, maybe they should give you a soda :)\n",

My only disappointment was that people openly violate the strict ordering policy, requiring them to move to the immediate left :) Obviously, I wanted them to yell 'no soup for you.'\n",

You can taste the tiny lobster pieces mixed in with the flavorful puree. Jambalaya is good and very hearty. Shrimp chowder is also good, but I rarely get it because the lobster bisque is my favorite!Only downside of eating here is there is nowhere to eat so you have to get it to go.

I'd not eaten breakfast or lunch and hadn't realized how it affected me until I struggled to climb some stairs.)Around the corner, a block away, is a little park where you can sit down and eat your soup. Or you can walk another 5 blocks to Central Park like I did.It's not cheap, but with each order they also toss in a slice of bread, fruit, and a piece of chocolate.

      "I totally came across this place by accident.  I was walking back to my hotel and then happened to see it one night.  It was already closed, around 10pm or so so it was definitely closed.  I wasn't even sure if the business was still running anymore, but I decided to come back and take a picture just for the fun of it.  When I came back, it was open.  So I thought why not? When in Rome...There's a sign for a Lobster Roll for $10.  It looked good so I was game.  I also ordered a small chicken gumbo which during my brain fart moment, I forgot it had okra and I'm not a huge okra fan.  They make the roll there as you wait as the soups are pretty much ready.  I was also given a banana and a piece of chocolate with a piece of bread for the soup.  The lobster roll was good, crispy bread, good lobster flavor that I got in every bite.  I couldn't complain.  As for the soup, the chicken was well cooked and there was good seasoning in the gumbo.  And the okra was good.  I'm usually reluctant to eat okra because it can be so sticky in consistency that I don't care for it but it was well done.  Good flavor and I guess the place isn't like anything on the \"Seinfeld\" episode where people yell at you.  The servers there were polite and cordial.  I actually liked the place and the food was good.  I would definitely come back! Enjoy!\n",

I got the lobster bisque, and you are not going to get this type of soup unless you go to fine restaurant, so its pretty neat that you can go to a soup stand and get flavorful soup with bread, fruit and chocolate.

It sounds transcendent.\n",

      "I have eaten at the original stand on a couple of ocassions. I have also eaten at a branch near 30 Rock too. That branch was very much different and it is now closed. They allowed you to sample different soups, have a seat, and watch TV. Al would not allow that at the original stand, and that's how I like it. too much flair. I enjoy this original stand where you had better order correctly or you might not get a bowl. Om my first trip to the original stand, I was prepared. I knew the rules. Al was at the stand on this day and he took my order. I said, \"seafood bisque, please\". He ladled the soup and handed it down the row to the cashier. She put the soup in a bag with bread, a spoon, and orange, and some chocolate. I took 4 steps to my left and handed her my money. She handed me the soup. It was one of the best things I hadever eaten. You can tell that Al really does have a passion for making great soup. Sure it can be a tourist trap, but it is worth it. I have never been when I had to stand in a very long line. I intend to make a stop at Al's on every visit to NYC. If you are ready to eat one of the best meals of your life(yes, a bowl of soup) stop by The Original Soupman.\n",

So crossing Times Square between shows is the actual pits. It's annoying. But let me tell you what's worth it. THE SOUPMAN. (There's one over on 6th Avenue. A more convenient location for me personally but it's NOT THE SAME. And I think it has different owners or something.) But this location on 8th is so good. My favorite (probably everyone's fave) is the lobster bisque. And today I got some Shrimp, Corn and Potato something something. It was GOOD!

Overall the Tomato Basil really wasn't that good, almost like to much citrus acid! Our Lobster Bisque was soso. Decent chunks of lobster, but after a few bites the flavor went away!

It wasn't amazing, and to put things into perspective, if I get something from the Soupman that isn't amazing I'm disappointed. That's a good sign they are great.

The only two people that was there didn't say a damn word. All they did was pointed at today's menu and scoffed. Wtf. Rude service. We don't know their name, but they worked at this location in Friday, June 27 at 5:09pm. They both need to be fired. I asked about a soup and the cashier said, \"lobster cream base soup, and I don't know what else is in there\" then she asks the chef. Not ONCE did they acknowledge our presence.When we are paying, she threw the receipt and pen down for us to sign. Not once did she greet us. Then we asked for an extra spoon because there was three of us sharing a soup (the chef only gave us one), when we asked, he rolled his fucken eye at us. Not once did they greet us when we GOT THERE. Not even when we left there! Even shacky place I been to greet the customers. I am NEVER going or recommend ANYONE going to this place. Received rude service and still had to pay $9!

I ordered a medium-size cup of the lobster bisque. It was a a little steep, ($10), but you do receive bread, a banana, and a piece of chocolate. The soup is really good. The soup was creamy, but not too thick. It had big pieces of lobster meat in it that I enjoyed. The bread was warm and was a great compliment to dip in the soup. Sadly, though, the chocolate could not be eaten as it melted. If you are a huge Seinfeld fan, or a soup fan, you will like this place.

The Original Soupman, in this it's original location, is more like a soup stand or soup kitchen (no fancy decor, but the set up works--with take out only please).  To place your order you'll probably have to stand in a small line, but it will give you a chance to look over the wall menu while you wait. They offer about 10 different soups on any day.   I opted for a ladle of the Seafood Chowder at $6, which was exceptionally good.  Lots of savory herbs and spices in a hearty broth.  And by hearty, I mean lots of seafood and fresh vegetables without all the potatoes that are sometimes used to give an illusion of heartiness.  The meal also comes along with a slice of artisanal wheat bread to soak deep down into your soup.By far, one of the best soups I've ever tasted!\n",

I went back at 11:35 am, and it still was not open. It opened around 11:40. I ordered the lobster roll and lobster bisque. The lobster roll was below average, but it was only 12 dollars which is a good deal. The bisque was OK - it seemed peppery.  Overall, it was OK. I took away a star for the late opening.\n",

      "Whoa!  $10 for a large lobster bisque from a soup stand, and the large is the size of a small at any other place!  So how was the lobster bisque, it was like they watered down the bisque and added a bunch of salt so it didn't taste watered down.  Yeah I guess it's nice that they give you a piece of fruit, bread, and a piece of chocolate; but why don't you just give me some decent soup instead at that price?\n",

      "Ok I'm not a soup lover, but I am a lover of Seinfeld, so a visit to the Soup Nazi was on the list to do.The Soup Kitchen International and its owner Al Yeganeh in Hell's Kitchen, was the inspiration for the Seinfeld episode about the Soup Nazi. Yeganeh who was born in Iran, is fictionally portrayed as the tyrannical soup man, making all of his customers follow a strict set of rules if they wish to buy a bowl of one of his coveted soups.Apparently Jerry Seinfeld went to The Soup Kitchen for lunch weeks after \"The Soup Nazi\" episode aired. It didn't go well. Yeganeh went into a profanity-filled rant about how the show had \"ruined\" his business and demanded an apology. Seinfeld allegedly gave the most insincere, sarcastic apology that ended with Yeganeh yelling \"No soup for you!\" and refused to serve him. Fact or fiction, I'll let you decide.Well I finally got to sample some of this infamous soup from the original shop (as its now franchised they've popped up everywhere in New York). Being a late Saturday afternoon, there was no line up and got to avoid the posted rules of: Pick the soup you want, Have your money ready, Move to the extreme left after ordering! And I have to say, the chicken barley was fantastic. But for $6, I was a bit disappointed in the tiny amount of soup you get. No wonder they give you bread, an apple and a Lindt chocolate to make up for it!If you're looking for great soup and a bit of TV history, head to the Soup Nazi in Hell's Kitchen. And maybe if you're really nice (or if you don't obey the rules), they just might yell \"No soup for you!\"\n",
      "*********\n",

      "I was a nervous wreck walking up to this soup establishment and wanted to follow all the rules given me on their website in order that I would be blessed with free bread and chocolate if I passed the test. With my groupon in hand I walked up and immediately had a breakdown because they didn't have the soup my fiancee wanted and I felt myself breaking all the rules. I had 3 sets of employee eyes on me and had to sneak myself around their glass door to make my quiet phone call to my fiancee to see what kind of soup he wanted. Thinking I had lost all chances of getting my extras, I took a breath and walked around to face the menu and read it off to him over the phone. After hanging up, I placed my order and my next step would have been to \"move to the extreme left\" which I did, but then moved back to the right because I still owed 11 cents after my groupon was redeemed. The employee told me not to worry about the 11 cents so I moved again to my extreme left and waited for my soup. While this was happening, a car was parallel parking near the curb and one of its wheels broke a glass cup that shattered and splattered all over my legs. No harm done, but what may have been the manager of the soup establishment, rushed over to ask if I was all right. Sure I was, I was wearing jeans! I was handed my bag of soup and I left.Upon seating myself in my car I opened the bag to find: my chunky tomato basil soup ($5), my fiancee's hearty beef chili soup ($6), bread, Lindt chocolates, AAAAAAAAAANNNDDDD two oranges!!!!! Everything was beyond delicious. (I'll never know if I received these extras because I followed the rules, or because of the pity taken on me by the employees due to what could have been a disaster had I not been wearing jeans.)\n",

But, the soup of my memories of cold wintery days standing in the snow waiting with my money and decision ready for AL to say NEXT - ARE GONE!!!I had heard on the radio that the Original Soup kitchen was reopening on 55th Street and I was anxious to stop by and say hello to AL - but all I found was some nice young girl collecting credit cards from the few people standing in line - all tourists.  Credit cards?  AL only took $$.But for old times sake, I ordered up the best memory I had of Lobster Bisque.  For $10 it came in a small container and when I got home I found a dinky piece of soft bread, a half melted chocolate something in a wrapper and a strawberry.  I couldn't wait to taste the soup - but what i got was a salty concoction with a few pieces of lobster floating around.  My wife pushed the container back to me and said she would pass.  I had a few spoonfuls but now the container rests all alone in the frig - next stop the garbage.  Hale and Hearty is across the street, and I'll return to them with my frequent souper ticket and leave the memories to just that, memories of fabulous soup served with an attitude.\n",

While I did not get to see the interior of the restaurant my review is based solely on the soup and bread I tried. The chicken gumbo was delicious (full of seasoning but not salty) but for $6.00 I thought the serving size was very small.  The bread was too tough for me to eat.  I would have preferred a larger cup of soup as opposed to a side of bread.  My mom enjoyed the bread and the orange that came with the soup. The purchase was a good deal for a meal on the run.\n",

Soup was unlike any broccoli and cheese I have had, but very tasty!

To partake in the Seinfeld universe will cost you however.  The small soup is truly small and the \"large\" is only slightly bigger.   You will indeed need to pay to play.  Volume of soup aside, the Jambalaya soup which I order was very hearty and tasty.  We did notice thought that the hot soup pot was lined with plastic cling wrap leaching who knows what into the soup.  The tiny soup + a slice of Italian loaf and a complimentary Lindor chocolate set me back 9 bucks.  It was fun, as a kind of touristy experience...but probably not worth a second visit.  Been there, done that.  We noticed, after slurping the last spoonful of soup a  Hale and Hearty soup outlet across the street. Cheaper I'm sure.\n",

Anyways, we just ordered a lobster bisque to share as we were doing a food tour of NYC and it was delicious.

It was a pilgrimage to go there , was very disappointed when one year he didn't come back from his annual vacation.I tried the chain when it first opened up, but it wasn't the same.  So when I heard the original was opening again, I had to get back there. Finally got a temperate summer day, so jumped on the subway and headed north to get some soup.It was pretty much like back in the day, but without Al. I ordered the large size lobster bisque for $10. I think it was smaller then what I used to get, but it was a good size. Very tasty with a good amount of lobster. I suspect now that the store has been made corporate , that there is less lobster, but it was still good. It came with a great piece of bread, some fresh fruit and a really good piece of chocolate.All and all it was very good, I don't think anything can compare to the original, but I inhaled the soup and really enjoyed it. Will be going back for sure.\n",

Ever since then I have gone to many, many restaurants and ordered the lobster bisque when it was featured, expecting to be able to recreate this magic. But who am I kidding? No one else actually puts pieces of lobster in their bisque - what they try to pass off is actually lobster \"essence\". Which is why to this day the Soup Nazi's lobster bisque is the standard by which all others are judged. Because at this sidewalk stand I get huge chucks of lobster in my bisque. Everywhere else, all you'll get is broth.\n",

There's no place to sit so make sure you get it to go. The fortunate thing is there's rarely a long line. Even when a tour bus pulls by the line is nothing like how it is in that Seinfeld episode.

      "the lentil soup is good, all the soup options seemed great actually, a small cup was a little too small in my opinion but you're paying for quality good standard soup here.the lobster rolls are a good deal, touch of butter and a nice toasted roll - not as tasty as luke's but definitely a better deal here\n",

      "lobster sandwich. pretty good. not sure if id return for it though. (a little pricey)(didnt get to try any soup.)\n",

      "This place is walk-up only, and I've never managed to catch them on the day that the crab bisque is available. You won't find better soup in the area - even at the adjacent Hale & Hearty. I'll drink that soup by the bucket. They refuse to sell it to me like that, though.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I had a large chicken noodle, which was $8. Great soup, great price. Don't forget that you get bread, fruit and a Lindt chocolate ball with each order. The staff is friendly and fast. In New York, it's tough to beat the value here.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What can I say, its an ICON and has excellent food. BE sure and go - try any soup - they are all amazingly good and fall into the COMFY food category.\n",

      "*********\n",
      "I had a crab corn chowder that was really good but not quite great and left me with horrible breath.  What I liked most about this place was that I thought $7 for a bowl of soup was a bit overpriced but when I sat down to eat it in central park I found that my bag contained not only soup and a slice of french bread, but also a banana and a chocolate.  Full meal.  Sweet!\n",
      "*********\n",

      "Creamy, bursting with flavor and a hint of spice- overall EXCELLENT lobster bisque. Good ratio of lobster in it too! Minus a star for how overpriced it is, but definitely a worthwhile indulgence.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Its not soup. Its art.Its not Soup. Its liquid Gold. The soup Nazi. Need i say more? If you saw the Seinfeld episode, You need no more convincing. Go for sure. And not too anybody's surprise, Be swift in the ordering process because if he likes you, you can get extra bread or fruit. The only problem is the price.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Good soup. Not quite the \"life altering experience\" my husband made it out to be, but still tasty. Love that the soup comes with bread, fruit, and chocolate. We walked right up on a hot summer day. The service seemed less than enthusiastic but still wasn't horrible. I would go again.\n",

      "Of course when we saw this place standing in line to see the Ball Drop, we said we had to come back. We are so happy we did. We got recommendations to get the Lobster Bisque and it turned out to be amazing!! Chicken Noodle was okay, I like mine better. Great little walk up for lunch. I wish they had some tables right outside of it, but it's okay. Will definitely go there again.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "My wife and I cannot start to describe how much we enjoyed the soup. We came as true Seinfeld fans but left as fans of the Original Soup Man! Don't miss this if you're in Manhattan!\n",

      "First - the soup was better when Al actually served soup from this location and he is a nice guy.  He was chatty with me.....The soup are note traditional nor are they cheap.  BUT I LOVE THEM!  The vendor inserts chunks of lobster in the bisque (not traditional).  There is less lobster and more filler now than before Al franchised.Avoid the NYC tourist tour buses.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So i've been here three times now. I normally eat across the street at Balduccis for lunch but decided that i'd give them a try. I got the Clam Chowder the first time I was there and it was out of this world. Very hearty and had a lot going on in there and they didn't put too many potatoes in which make it even better. I tried the Lobster Bisque because of what all the reviews said and I was quite disappointed(reason for 3 not 4 stars) there were whole chunks of lobster in the bisque and a lot of ti which you would think would be great but because it sits in hot soup the whole time the lobster becomes very overcooked and unenjoyable to eat. My recommendation don't go for the lobster bisque. Today I went back and got the Lobster Roll and that was fantastic, small but delicious. The roll was a little to buttery for me and the prices are quite high for a grab and go lunch place which is the reason for the 2nd star missing. Overall though good place and will be back to try another soup. Italian Wedding looks good. They also don't let you sample the soup which makes a lot of sense, but is rather annoying because if i'm going to spend 10 dollars on soup I want to make sure that i love it.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "): I have it on great authority that they dont even make their own soup - they get it from somewhere else. That's pretty disappointing. But even so, it's pretty decent\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I must say,  I thought this would be another \"tourist trap\".   I am a New Englander and I decided to try the clam chowder.  Delicious!   It came with a nice slice of very good bread and a banana.    It was as good as anything I've had in Boston or elsewhere!  Will try a different soup every time I am back in NYC.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Good taste but too small and expensive.  Lobster roll was same size as a hot dog.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Maybe the soup is acceptable. I haven't tried any. But whatever you do, skip the advertised lobster roll. It's truly awful! Although the photos show the lobster as red (which is the color of cooked lobster) the pieces in my roll were brownish. the shredded lettuce was also brownish. And there was some kind of mystery  sauce on it. Worse yet, there was a definite odor of onions or of something else cooked on a grill. It arrived all wrapped, and so I didn't have a clue what I was getting until I was home barely 5 minutes later The roll is now $12, not $10. I know Soup Man is  a franchise operation. and different locations may be better. I live in the area and remember when the \"Soup Nazi\" was there; daily lines snaked around the block. No lines now, not at all.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The clam chowder was great, tasted light. Comes with an orange and bread!\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Amazing lunch deal. Really high-quality homemade soups (not those gross rehydrated soups from fast food places like Cosi). Plus, for $5 you get a small soup, a really good piece of crusty bread, a tiny cute apple, AND a chocolate!\n",

      "Years ago when Al used to manage the shop at 55th during winter months, there was something terrifyingly attractive about Soup Kitchen International, aka The Soup Nazi, while the soup itself was something out of this world.  Now that \"they\" are back, it's not quite the same (you likely won't see Al there, so the rules of engagement are a little loose).  While the soup still rocks, the anxiety and excitement about the Soup Nazi is a thing of the past, which is why I didn't give it a five-star rating.  Yes, the experience was half the fun, especially if you got to see him send someone away.  I also hesitate to rate it so highly because, well, this liquid gold is priced like the yellow stuff.  Also, the franchising of the brand has taken away that sense of uniqueness.  Nevertheless, the soup remains NY's best, even though it's processed, frozen, delivered, then thawed and cook at their locations.  But I suppose this was Al's gift to those not in the Hell's Kitchen / midtown Manhattan area who pined for a true gift from the culinary gods.  Other than the soup itself, the one aspect of their return that I really appreciate is its year-'round availability, so even during the summer months when it's 90 degrees outside, you can still enjoy some awesome soup.  This location is only a walk up, so if you need a place to dine, and it's at the end of the lunch hour, go back to Broadway heading downtown.  About a block after the Ed Sullivan Theater where Letterman has his show, on the southeast corner, is a little buffet-style place typical for Manhattan, with an upstairs dining room open to the public that even has a sushi bar and a restroom.  Buy a drink to go with your soup and walk up to the dining room.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Awesome. So tasty, authentic. When I went there was no line, they take credit card and they it was quick. If you love soup, run don't walk.\n",

      "Strolling back to the Hilton, I saw it. It struck me like lightning. It was the Soup Man. I did a double take. I could not believe what I was seeing. Then I thought, \"Soup for me!\" I crossed the street, but kept my distance, like approaching an unfamiliar dog. I didn't want to mess-up my one shot to order soup and then get banned. I read the menu in about 15 seconds and knew what I wanted.  They had a soup & T-shirt special for $20, which was a great deal, but I passed.Greeting me with a SOUPER smile and anxious to help, THE SOUP MAN himself and his helper asked me, \"what would you like?\" Quickly (and a bit nervous) I asked for Lobster Bisque and a Lobster Roll, only $20 together. The large soup and lobster roll came quickly and it was placed in an exclusive, cool, Soup Man bag. I went back to the hotel to eat it. It was a great experience just ordering!!! I opened the bag and there was a spoon, napkins, a chunk of bread, my soup and lobster roll.  I was giddy!  As for the soup.......it was real and it was spectacular. Large chunks of lobster, super creamy soup, nice complimentary flavors, it could not have been better unless I had a gallon of it. The lobster roll was ok. You will not believe what I am complaining about either, forgive me. I expected chunks of lobster, a little mayo, a touch of Old Bay and some celery in the roll. However, there was hardly a drop of mayo on the roll.  It was great lobster on a hotdog bun though. I am not sure if they always make them like that, but that is how mine was. For all the NEGATIVE people out there. THIS IS NOT CAMPBELL\"S SOUP. If you want cheap, get a can. The Soup Man should be a special thing, like expensive coffee. Only an idiot would buy a $5 coffee everyday.  I couldn't afford $10 for soup everyday, but coming from Chicago, it was worth every penny and I would buy it as a treat! Soup Man does box his soup in the grocery store now and I will get some as a treat. Will I still buy Campbell's Tomato Soup for my grilled cheese? Yep! However, back in Chicago, if I have been extra good, it will be SOUP FOR ME with the Soup Man! 9/10. I still have the bag too!\n",

      "My husband and I went to NYC for our honeymoon and seriously....this is the best lobster bisque in the world!!!! The staff there were so sweet and it was a true new york experience. And coming all the way from Hawaii...it was AMAZING!!! Can't wait to return in Oct '12.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Can't go wrong with the lobster bisque! Perfect pick me up on a cold day. The guy at the counter was definitely friendlier than the infamous soup Nazi.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "On our recent trip to NYC my boyfriend made it a mission to find a good lobster roll.  After searching on Yelp and reading some reviews we decided on coming to the Original Soupman.  We had the lobster roll for $10 and it was amazing!  Every bite brought a smile to my face!  There were huge chunks of lobster and it was super tasty.  I recommend giving this place a try!\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It had been raining steadily all day long. After the wind flipped my umbrella inside-out that I had to dump it, I decided to get some soup.  I ran risk of being too full for dinner, but I was visiting NYC and this was my chance to try The Original Soupman of Seinfeld lore.  When I got there at quarter to five, I was the only one there.  The No Soup For You guy was not there, just some college-aged kids.  I bought a large lobster bisque, then proceeded to find a place where I can duck into from the rain to enjoy my pre-dinner treat.  The newspaper stand next door had an awning that would have sufficed, but I did not want to enjoy my first taste of this legendary soup standing up in the rain.  Right around the corner was a Wendy's with upstairs seating.  I buy a soda to legitimize my presence there and head upstairs.  My first bite of the lobster bisque had more lobster in there than any other fancy place serving lobster bisque or pasta with lobster.  The warmth and flavors weren't so overwhelmingly rich that you're done after five bites, like some other places I have been to. The $10 price tag is really a bargain with all that obviously went into this soup.  After my first experience, I am convinced that their reputation is well-deserved.  Is there a website like WikiLeaks but for recipes? Because I need to find a way to have this soup more often.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I am NOT a soup person, so when I pay $10 for a cup, you know its spectacular. After trying thanks to living social, it has become a monthly winter buy\n",

      "*********\n",
      "Don't really like lobster, simply had the lobster bisque, because that was one of the soups ordered on Seinfeld, but it was by far the best soup I've ever tasted. The soup had a very generous amount of lobster. The soup came with bread, a banana, and lindt chocolate @ no extra charge.\n",

      "Plain and simple...best lobster bisque I've ever had.\n",

      "I forgot what I ate. I think it was something with chicken, but it was so good. My bf had the Lobster Bisque and I vow to have that the next time I go there. It was sooooo good. I wish I could've had the original one from the Seinfeld episode. I wouldn't want to break any rules!\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I've had a few soups, all outstanding. Lobster roll was above average, enjoy the no frills look and service. Priceyness is the only downside.\n",
      "*********\n",

Then again, I haven't lived in New York in a long time and I stopped going here even longer ago, so who knows. Soup's not bad, though.\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I need to go back because I didn't have one of the famous specialities.  The Gespacho was not bad, and you can't beat the price.  I got a large portion of soup, bread, a banana and a Lindor Truffle all for about $8.  This is the original location btw, and when I was there I saw the man who started it all and inspired probably the best Seinfeld episode.\n",

      "Went to the 55th st location and got the lobster roll and chicken gumbo after hearing all the hype over the Seinfeld connection. . Too much salt on everything. Didn't expect the lobster roll to be cold. The bits of meat that weren't covered in salt and pepper was tasteless like surimi. I liked the texture and taste of the buttered roll. Nice presentation. The soup cup is packed in a little shopping bag with a complimentary apple. The store looks kitschy with the t-shirt and mug merchandising. The staff were bored and sleepy when we got there at 6 on a Saturday but they got in gear as more people stopped by. I see other Soupman outlets in other parts of the city but I doubt I'd visit again. Too bad. I wanted to like Soupman.\n",

The Mulligatawny soup, however, which my bf ordered, was AWESOME! One of the best soups I've ever had.  I also enjoyed the bread that came with the soup, fresh and tasty.  Nice touch that they also give you a piece of fruit with your order.\n",
