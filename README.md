# The Original Soupman Yelp Review Semantic Analysis

Using Beautiful Soup to scrape reviews from The Original Soupman's yelp page I searched for menu items mentioned in the reviews and extracted them to preform an analysis on the sentiments  
around each found item. To be honest every part of this project frustrated me but I am proud I was able to complete it.
